On coral reefs, an additional challenge is to disentangle the relative influence of multiple drivers that operate at different stages of coral ontogeny. We integrated coral life history, population dynamics, and spatially explicit environmental drivers to assess the relative and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors across 2,300 km of the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Using literature data, we characterized relationships between coral life history processes (reproduction, larval dispersal, recruitment, growth, and mortality) and environmental variables. We then simulated coral demographics and stressor impacts at the organism (coral colony) level on {\textgreater}3,800 individual reefs linked by larval connectivity and exposed to temporally and spatially realistic regimes of acute (crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, cyclones, and mass coral bleaching) and chronic (water-quality) stressors. Model simulations produced a credible reconstruction of recent (2008–2020) coral trajectories consistent with monitoring observations, while estimating the impacts of each stressor at reef and regional scales. Overall, simulated coral populations declined by one-third across the GBR, from an average of 29\% to 19\% hard coral cover. By 2020, {\textless}20\% of the GBR had coral cover higher than 30\%, a status of reef health corroborated by scarce and sparsely distributed monitoring data. Reef-wide annual rates of coral mortality were driven by bleaching (48\%) ahead of cyclones (41\%) and starfish predation (11\%). Beyond the reconstructed status and trends, the model enabled the emergence of complex interactions that compound the effects of multiple stressors while promoting a mechanistic understanding of coral cover dynamics. Drivers of coral cover growth were identified; notably, water quality (suspended sediments) was estimated to delay recovery for at least 25\% of inshore reefs. Standardized rates of coral loss and recovery allowed the integration of all cumulative impacts to determine the equilibrium cover for each reef. This metric, combined with maps of impacts, recovery potential, water-quality thresholds, and reef state metrics, facilitates strategic spatial planning and resilience-based management across the GBR. © 2021 The Ecological Society of America.","Publisher: Ecological Society of America | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,check full text",,Australia;bleaching;community dynamics;coral reef;Coral Sea;ecological impact;environmental impact assessment;Great Barrier Reef;life history;management practice;marine ecosystem;Queensland;spatial planning;water quality;heat stress;resilience;cyclones;coral populations;crown-of-thorns starfish;disturbances;individual-based model;spatial simulations;strategic management,,

Here, we propose that metabolism measurement tools and methods could also be used to monitor reef ecosystem change in response to coral restoration. This review paper provides a general introduction to net ecosystem metabolism and carbon chemistry for coral reef ecosystems, followed by a review of five metabolism monitoring methods with potential for application to coral reef restoration monitoring. Selected methodologies included those with measurement scales appropriate to assess outplant arrays and whole reef ecosystem outcomes associated with restoration interventions. Subsequently we discuss how water column and CO2 chemistry could be used to address coral restoration monitoring research gaps and scale up from biological, colony-level metrics to ecosystem-scale function and performance assessments. Such function-based measurements could potentially be used to inform several goal-based monitoring objectives highlighted in the Coral Reef Restoration Monitoring Guide. Lastly, this review discusses important methodological factors, such as scale, reef type, and flow environment, that should be considered when determining which metabolism monitoring technique would be most appropriate for a reef restoration project. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Publisher: Springer | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Coral reef;Ecosystems;Alkalinity;Alkalinity anomaly;Biomineralization;Budget control;Carbon;Carbon budgets;Coral reef restoration;Ecosystem metabolism monitoring;Ecosystem metabolisms;Measurement tools;Metabolism;Monitoring;Monitoring methods;Net ecosystem calcification;Net ecosystem production;Reefs;Restoration,,

We examined spatio-temporal patterns in AR deployment in tropical and subtropical coral reefs (up to 35° latitude) and evaluated their efficacy in meeting conservation objectives, using a systematic review of the scientific literature. Most deployments (136 studies) were in the North Atlantic and Central Indo-Pacific in 1980s - 2000s, with a pronounced shift to the Western Indo-Pacific in 2010s. Use of ARs in reef restoration or stressor mitigation increased markedly in response to accelerating coral decline over the last 2 decades. Studies that evaluated success in meeting conservation objectives (n = 51) commonly reported increasing fish abundance (55\%), enhancing habitat quantity (31\%) or coral cover (27\%), and conserving target species (24\%). Other objectives included stressor mitigation (22\%), provision of coral nursery habitat (14\%) or source populations (2\%) and addressing socio-cultural and economic values (16\%). Fish (55\% of studies) and coral (53\%) were the most commonly monitored taxa. Success in achieving conservation objectives was reported in 33 studies. Success rates were highest for provision of nursery habitat and increasing coral cover (each 71\%). Increasing fish abundance or habitat quantity, mitigating environmental impacts, and attaining socio-cultural objectives were moderately successful (60-64\%); conservation of target species was the least successful (42\%). Failure in achieving objectives commonly was attributed to poor AR design or disruption by large-scale bleaching events. The scale of ARs generally was too small (m2 - 10s m2) to address regional losses in coral cover, and study duration too short ({\textless} 5 years) to adequately assess ecologically relevant trends in coral cover and community composition. ARs are mostly likely to aid in reef conservation and restoration by providing nursery habitat for target species or recruitment substrate for corals and other organisms. Promoting local socio-cultural values also has potential for regional or global impact by increasing awareness of coral reef decline, if prioritized and properly monitored. © 2022 Higgins et al.

Increasing management capacity on reefs requires prioritization of the development of data-based water-quality thresholds and tipping points. To meet this urgent need of marine resource managers, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that quantified the effects on scleractinian corals of chemical pollutants from land-based and atmospheric sources. We compiled a global dataset addressing the effects of these pollutants on coral growth, mortality, reproduction, physiology, and behavior. The resulting quantitative review of 55 articles includes information about industrial sources, modes of action, experimentally tested concentrations, and previously identified tolerance thresholds of corals to 13 metals, 18 pesticides, 5 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and a pharmaceutical. For data-rich contaminants, we make more robust threshold estimates by adapting models for Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis that were originally developed for biopharmaceutical application. These models use information from multiple studies to characterize the dose-response relationships (i.e., Emax curves) between a pollutant's concentration and various measures of coral health. Metals used in antifouling paints, especially copper, have received a great deal of attention to-date, thus enabling us to estimate the cumulative impact of copper across coral's early life-history. The effects of other land-based pollutants on corals are comparatively understudied, which precludes more quantitative analysis. We discuss opportunities to improve future research so that it can be better integrated into quantitative assessments of the effects of more pollutant types on sublethal coral stress-responses. We also recommend that managers use this information to establish more conservative water quality thresholds that account for the synergistic effects of multiple pollutants on coral reefs. Ultimately, active remediation of local stressors will improve the resistance, resilience, and recovery of individual reefs and reef ecosystems facing the global threat of climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Publisher: Elsevier B.V. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,CEESAT done,meta-analysis,systematic review",,Water quality;bleaching;coral reef;climate change;Climate change;Coral reef;Coral Reefs;ecosystem;Ecosystem;Ecosystems;environmental impact;Review;animal;Animals;Reefs;coral;nonhuman;systematic review;Information management;lead;Anthozoa;pollution effect;EC50;Cnidaria;1 methyl naphthalene;aluminum;Bayes theorem;Bayes Theorem;Bayesian analysis;Bayesian modelling;Bayesian network;Bayesian networks;benzo pyrene;cadmium;carbaril;chlorophyll;chlorpyrifos;coastal development;cobalt;concentration (parameter);copper;Copper;coral adult;coral gamete;coral juvenile;coral larva;data synthesis;Data synthesis;diuron;dose response;Dose response;dose-response relationship;Ecosystem functions;Ecosystem services;endosulfan;environmental management;fungicide;gallium;gamete;Impacts on corals;insecticide;iron;management;manganese;Marine biology;mercury;meta analysis;meta-analysis;Meta-analysis;metal;metamorphosis;naphthalene;nickel;PAH;PCB;permethrin;polychlorinated biphenyl;Polychlorinated biphenyls;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;profenofos;Quality control;quantitative analysis;Scleractinia;Scleractinium;seashore;symbiont;symbiont density;Systematic Review;tin;unclassified drug;vanadium;water contamination;water quality;Water Quality;water quality threshold;zinc;Management;Bayesian model;Dose-response;Pollutant,,

The need for concerted and collaborative action focused on the recovery of coral reef ecosystems coalesced in the creation of the Coral Restoration Consortium (CRC) in 2017. In March 2020, the CRC leadership team met for a biennial review of international coral reef restoration efforts and a discussion of perceived knowledge and implementation bottlenecks that may impair scalability and efficacy. Herein we present six priorities wherein the CRC will foster scientific advancement and collaboration to: (1) increase restoration efficiency, focusing on scale and cost-effectiveness of deployment; (2) scale up larval-based coral restoration efforts, emphasizing recruit health, growth, and survival; (3) ensure restoration of threatened coral species proceeds within a population-genetics management context; (4) support a holistic approach to coral reef ecosystem restoration; (5) develop and promote the use of standardized terms and metrics for coral reef restoration; and (6) support coral reef restoration practitioners working in diverse geographic locations. These priorities are not exhaustive nor do we imply that accomplishing these tasks alone will be sufficient to restore coral reefs globally; rather these are topics where we feel the CRC community of practice can make timely and significant contributions to facilitate the growth of coral reef restoration as a practical conservation strategy. The goal for these collective actions is to provide tangible, local-scale advancements in reef condition that offset declines resulting from local and global stressors including climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

The rate of adaptation to climate change is proportional to the amount of phenotypic variation that can be inherited by subsequent generations (i.e., narrow-sense heritability, h2). Thus, traits that have higher heritability (e.g., h2 \&gt; 0.5) are likely to adapt to future conditions faster than traits with lower heritability (e.g., h2 \&lt; 0.1). Here, we synthesize 95 heritability estimates across 19 species of reef-building corals. Our meta-analysis reveals low heritability (h2 \&lt; 0.25) of gene expression metrics, intermediate heritability (h2 = 0.25–0.50) of photochemistry, growth, and bleaching, and high heritability (h2 \&gt; 0.50) for metrics related to survival and immune responses. Some of these values are higher than typically observed in other taxa, such as survival and growth, while others were more comparable, such as gene expression and photochemistry. There was no detectable effect of temperature on heritability, but narrow-sense heritability estimates were generally lower than broad-sense estimates, indicative of significant non-additive genetic variation across traits. Trait heritability also varied depending on coral life stage, with bleaching and growth in juveniles generally having lower heritability compared to bleaching and growth in larvae and adults. These differences may be the result of previous stabilizing selection on juveniles or may be due to constrained evolution resulting from genetic trade-offs or genetic correlations between growth and thermotolerance. While we find no evidence that heritability decreases under temperature stress, explicit tests of the heritability of thermal tolerance itself—such as coral thermal reaction norm shape—are lacking. Nevertheless, our findings overall reveal high trait heritability for the majority of coral traits, suggesting corals may have a greater potential to adapt to climate change than has been assumed in recent evolutionary models. © 2021 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,check full text",,coral reef;climate change;Climate Change;Coral Reefs;animal;Animals;genetics;Anthozoa;meta analysis;meta-analysis;Scleractinia;acclimatization;Acclimatization;adaptation;Adaptation;heritability;natural selection;Physiological;temperature tolerance;animal model;evolution;Breeder's equation;scleractinia;thermal tolerance,,

These diseases are often difficult to separate in the field as they produce similar gross signs. Here we aimed to compare what we know about WPD and SCTLD in terms of: (1) pathology, (2) etiology, and (3) epizootiology. We reviewed over 114 peer-reviewed publications from 1973 to 2021. Overall, WPD and SCTLD resemble each other macroscopically, mainly due to the rapid tissue loss they produce in their hosts, however, SCTLD has a more concise case definition. Multiple-coalescent lesions are often observed in colonies with SCTLD and rarely in WPD. A unique diagnostic sign of SCTLD is the presence of bleached circular areas when SCTLD lesions are first appearing in the colony. The paucity of histopathologic archives for WPDs for multiple species across geographies makes it impossible to tell if WPD is the same as SCTLD. Both diseases alter the coral microbiome. WPD is controversially regarded as a bacterial infection and more recently a viral infection, whereas for SCTLD the etiology has not been identified, but the putative pathogen, likely to be a virus, has not been confirmed yet. Most striking differences between WPD and SCTLD have been related to duration and phases of epizootic events and mortality rates. While both diseases may become highly prevalent on reefs, SCTLD seems to be more persistent even throughout years. Both transmit directly (contact) and horizontally (waterborne), but organism-mediated transmission is only proven for WPD-II. Given the differences and similarities between these diseases, more detailed information is needed for a better comparison. Specifically, it is important to focus on: (1) tagging colonies to look at disease progression and tissue mortality rates, (2) tracking the fate of the epizootic event by looking at initial coral species affected, the features of lesions and how they spread over colonies and to a wider range of hosts, (3) persistence across years, and (4) repetitive sampling to look at changes in the microbiome as the disease progresses.

Soft corals (order Alcyonacea) provide reef structure and habitat, but most reef research has instead focused on reef-building hard corals (order Scleractinia). Reviewing the primary literature documenting the effects of recent (2014–2020) marine heatwaves on corals, a period including the third global coral bleaching event, we found that only 20\% (19/94) of studies presented any results of heat stress effects on soft corals, and even fewer (5\%) presented taxonomic-specific results, highlighting the need for further study. Using images (n = 6265) collected on 16 expeditions to the world's largest atoll (Kiritimati; central equatorial Pacific) between 2007 and 2019, we quantified soft coral cover around the atoll's shallow (10-12 m depth) forereefs before and after a prolonged heatwave (the 2015/2016 El Niño). Prior to the heatwave, soft coral accounted for 3.0\% of the benthic community, with greater cover at more sheltered sites with lower net primary productivity; Lobophytum and Sinularia were the most common genera. We documented a complete loss of soft coral after the heatwave within our sites. New soft corals were detected in 2019, three years after the heatwave. Photos of individual colonies tracked over time revealed that soft coral structures can persist for several years post-mortality, and hard corals can recruit onto these structures. Our study exposes the vulnerability of soft corals to heat stress, which has received scant previous documentation.

Recently, these marginal reefs have been hypothesized to provide climate-change refugia from natural and anthropogenic impacts; yet with little empirical evidence. Therefore, in this article we discuss the known effects of multiple pressures on the Brazilian reefs. A wide evaluation of the peer reviewed literature reported that bleaching events affected 26 species of scleractinians, hydrocorals, octocorals, and zoanthids in turbid-zone reefs over the last 26 years (1994–2020) in the Tropical SW Atlantic Brazil. Between 1994 and 2018 no species suffered post-bleaching mass mortality. However, the recent and intense heatwaves of 2019 and 2020 caused higher mortality rates in several key foundation corals (e.g., Millepora alcicornis, Millepora braziliensis, and Mussismilia harttii) showing that the SW Atlantic reefs are not long-term protected and universal refuges. Moreover, other direct and indirect human pressures threaten these tropical reefs. Local and regional (e.g., pollution and fisheries) and large-scale pressures (e.g., global warming and marine heatwaves) act simultaneously on the health of these reefs, which intensifies negative species-specific impacts. We outline the occurrence of pressures that have been important factors responsible for the reduction in species richness and reef fish biomass, changing geo-ecological functions, altered reef composition and dominant morpho-functional groups, as well as phase shifts. Along with large-scale climatic changes, such as heatwaves, fisheries, urbanization, mining disasters, oil spills, increased sedimentation, increased warming, marine debris, contamination by domestic, agricultural, and industrial effluents, and introduction of invasive species are likely the most severe pressures on Brazilian reefs. We discuss that the “Brazilian reef refuge hypothesis” could be partially applied for some stress-tolerant massive corals during acute disturbances (short-term refuge); yet should not be assumed as a reef ecosystem-wide feature under ongoing environmental change. Therefore, we argue that it is essential to alleviate the main local and regional human impacts and to adopt resilient-based management strategies at local and global scales to protect the low-functional redundancy and higher endemism of these unique marginal coral reefs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,bleaching;coral reef;Climate change;Coral reef;Ecosystems;Marine pollution;Reefs;coral;Oil spills;Fisheries;Anthozoa;heat wave;anthropogenic effect;Brazil;invasive species;Sewage;Morpho;Shallow waters;Atlantic Ocean;Atlantic Ocean (Southwest);Bleaching;Changing environment;Cleaning;Condition;Coral bleaching;endemism;environmental effect;Forestry;Global warming;Heat waves;Large-scales;mass mortality;Millepora alcicornis;Millepora braziliensis;Mussismilia harttii;Resilience;shallow water;Southwestern Atlantic;Southwestern Atlantic Ocean;species richness;Stylasteridae;tropical environment;Tropics;Zoanthidea;Coral reef conservation,,

Currently, the most successful approach for restoring degraded reefs is ‘coral gardening’, where corals are farmed in underwater nurseries, then outplanted to damaged reefs. Dealing with enhanced coral adaptation, the ‘coral gardening’ approach is conceptually structured here within a hierarchical list of five encircling tiers that include all restoration activities, focusing on the nursery phase. Each tier encompasses all the activities performed in the levels below it hierarchically. The first is the ‘coral mariculture’ tier, followed by the ‘ecological engineering’ tier. The third is the adaptation-based reef restoration (ABRR) tier, preceding the fourth (‘ecosystem seascape’) and the fifth (‘ecosystem services’) tiers. The ABRR tier is further conceptualized and its constituent five classes (phenotypic plasticity, assisted migration, epigenetics, coral chimerism, holobiont modification) are detailed. It is concluded that the nursery phase of the ‘gardening’ tenet may further serve as a platform to enhance the adaptation capacities of corals to climate change through the five ABBR classes. Employing the ‘gardening’ tiers in reef restoration without considering ABRR will scarcely be able to meet global targets for healthy reef ecosystems in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Publisher: Academic Press | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;marine ecosystem;climate change;Climate Change;Coral Reefs;ecosystem;Ecosystem;animal;Animals;human;coral;nonhuman;nursery;review;Anthozoa;adaptive management;anthropogenic effect;environmental protection;restoration ecology;adaptation;Adaptation;Physiological;Conservation of Natural Resources;chimera;ecosystem health;epigenetics;gardening;Gardening;human impact (environment);mariculture;microbiome;phenotypic plasticity,,

With projected coral reef decline, it is likely that coral specimens for bleaching research will increasingly become a more limited resource in the future. By adopting a holistic approach through increased collaborations, coral bleaching scientists can maximize a specimen’s investigative yield, thus reducing the need to remove more coral material from the reef. Yet to expand a specimen’s utility for additional analytic methods, information on how corals are collected is essential as many methods are variably sensitive to upstream handling and processing. In an effort to identify common practices for coral collection, sacrifice, preservation, and processing in coral bleaching research, we surveyed the literature from the last 6.5 years and created and analyzed the resulting dataset of 171 publications. Since January 2014, at least 21,890 coral specimens were collected for bleaching surveys or bleaching experiments. These specimens spanned 122 species of scleractinian corals where the most frequently sampled were Acropora millepora, Pocillopora damicornis, and Stylophora pistillata. Almost 90\% of studies removed fragments from the reef, 6\% collected skeletal cores, and 3\% collected mucus specimens. The most common methods for sacrificing specimens were snap freezing with liquid nitrogen, chemical preservation (e.g., with ethanol or nucleic acid stabilizing buffer), or airbrushing live fragments. We also characterized 37 distinct methodological pathways from collection to processing of specimens in preparation for a variety of physiological, -omic, microscopy, and imaging analyses. Interestingly, almost half of all studies used only one of six different pathways. These similarities in collection, preservation, and processing methods illustrate that archived coral specimens could be readily shared among researchers for additional analyses. In addition, our review provides a reference for future researchers who are considering which methodological pathway to select to maximize the utility of coral bleaching specimens that they collect. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

In addition, eutrophication poses an increasing threat to coral reef environments and has been found to increase the vulnerability of corals to thermal bleaching. Eutrophication has accelerated in recent years with coastal nutrient loads expected to continue to increase under global change. However, the mechanisms by which nutrient pollution affects corals and coral reefs are still under debate, in particular with regard to nitrogen. The main objective of this paper is to review mechanisms by which nitrogen pollution affects coral health and corresponding strategies to reduce the impact of nitrogen pollution. Different coral species possess varying tolerance thresholds for nitrogen enrichment and corals show differential responses to enrichment with nitrate and ammonium. Nitrate assimilation increases oxidative stress in corals, promotes growth of the phototrophic symbionts in corals, and induces phosphate starvation in these symbionts, which further impairs the symbiosis. In contrast, a moderate supply of ammonium is mostly beneficial for coral development. In addition, combined nitrogen and phosphorous enrichment can indirectly compromise coral health by enhancing macroalgae growth and increasing the incidence of coral diseases caused by predation on corals. It must be realized that both levels of nutrient pollution and the stoichiometric ratios of C: N: P: Fe availabilities determine the ultimate effect of nutrients on coral health. We confirm the strategy to conserve coral reefs via coral-targeted water quality management, in particular by including a reduction of the nitrate influx and by proper management of fish stocks to facilitate healthy reef ecology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Publisher: Elsevier B.V. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Water quality;bleaching;coral reef;climate change;Climate change;environmental impact;marine pollution;Review;human;Reefs;nonhuman;Pollution;Anthozoa;pollution effect;water pollution;Coral;symbiosis;water quality;nitrogen;Nitrogen;conservation management;Water management;Bleaching;Cleaning;Coral bleaching;Nutrients;ammonia;Differential response;eutrophication;Eutrophication;evolutionary adaptation;global climate;Global climate changes;Health;Matthiola;nitrate;Nitrate assimilation;Nitrates;Nitrogen enrichment;Nitrogen pollution;Phosphate starvation;Phosphorous enrichments;phosphorus;phototrophy;predation;Quality management;Stoichiometric ratio;stoichiometry;strategic approach;water conservation;Water conservation;water management;Coral disease;Nutrient;Phosphorous,,

The increasing frequency of massive bleaching events in the tropics is highlighting the need to better understand the stages of coral physiological responses to extreme conditions. Moreover, like many other coastal regions, coral reef ecosystems are facing additional localized anthropogenic stressors such as nutrient loading, increased turbidity, and coastal development. Different strategies have been developed to measure the health status of a damaged reef, ranging from the resolution of individual polyps to the entire coral community, but techniques for measuring coral physiology in situ are not yet widely implemented. For instance, while there are many studies of the coral holobiont response in single or limited-number multiple stressor experiments, they provide only partial insights into metabolic performance under more complex and temporally and spatially variable natural conditions. Here, we discuss the current status of coral reefs and their global and local stressors in the context of experimental techniques that measure core processes in coral metabolism (respiration, photosynthesis, and biocalcification) in situ, and their role in indicating the health status of colonies and communities. We highlight the need to improve the capability of in situ studies in order to better understand the resilience and stress response of corals under multiple global and local scale stressors. © Copyright © 2021 Dellisanti, Chung, Chow, Wu, Wells and Chan.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;Review;nonhuman;sea surface temperature;reactive oxygen metabolite;aquatic environment;environmental monitoring;waste water management;metabolomics;symbiosis;water quality;controlled study;seagrass;microbial community;dynamics;biogeochemistry;biomass production;fluorescence imaging;fluorometry;geographic distribution;microbial diversity;microbial metabolism;photochemistry;physiological stress;productivity;respirometry;temperature stress;zonation,,

Integrating the diverse body of work on coral bleaching is critical to understanding and combating this global problem. Yet investigating the drivers, patterns, and processes of coral bleaching poses a major challenge. A recent review of published experiments revealed a wide range of experimental variables used across studies. Such a wide range of approaches enhances discovery, but without full transparency in the experimental and analytical methods used, can also make comparisons among studies challenging. To increase comparability but not stifle innovation, we propose a common framework for coral bleaching experiments that includes consideration of coral provenance, experimental conditions, and husbandry. For example, reporting the number of genets used, collection site conditions, the experimental temperature offset(s) from the maximum monthly mean (MMM) of the collection site, experimental light conditions, flow, and the feeding regime will greatly facilitate comparability across studies. Similarly, quantifying common response variables of endosymbiont (Symbiodiniaceae) and holobiont phenotypes (i.e., color, chlorophyll, endosymbiont cell density, mortality, and skeletal growth) could further facilitate cross-study comparisons. While no single bleaching experiment can provide the data necessary to determine global coral responses of all corals to current and future ocean warming, linking studies through a common framework as outlined here, would help increase comparability among experiments, facilitate synthetic insights into the causes and underlying mechanisms of coral bleaching, and reveal unique bleaching responses among genets, species, and regions. Such a collaborative framework that fosters transparency in methods used would strengthen comparisons among studies that can help inform coral reef management and facilitate conservation strategies to mitigate coral bleaching worldwide. © 2021 The Authors.

This is because the calcifying coral reef taxa that construct the calcium carbonate frameworks and cement the reef together are highly sensitive to ocean warming and acidification. However, the global-scale effects of ocean warming and acidification on rates of coral reef net carbonate production remain poorly constrained despite a wealth of studies assessing their effects on the calcification of individual organisms. Here, we present global estimates of projected future changes in coral reef net carbonate production under ocean warming and acidification. We apply a meta-analysis of responses of coral reef taxa calcification and bioerosion rates to predicted changes in coral cover driven by climate change to estimate the net carbonate production rates of 183 reefs worldwide by 2050 and 2100. We forecast mean global reef net carbonate production under representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 will decline by 76, 149, and 156\%, respectively, by 2100. While 63\% of reefs are projected to continue to accrete by 2100 under RCP2.6, 94\% will be eroding by 2050 under RCP8.5, and no reefs will continue to accrete at rates matching projected sea level rise under RCP4.5 or 8.5 by 2100. Projected reduced coral cover due to bleaching events predominately drives these declines rather than the direct physiological impacts of ocean warming and acidification on calcification or bioerosion. Presently degraded reefs were also more sensitive in our analysis. These findings highlight the low likelihood that the world’s coral reefs will maintain their functional roles without near-term stabilization of atmospheric CO2 emissions. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The work presented here aimed to lay the foundation towards development of effective methods to sort and culture reef-building coral cells with the ultimate goal of obtaining immortal cell lines for the study of bleaching, disease and toxicity at the cellular and polyp levels. To achieve this objective, the team conducted a thorough review and tested the available methods (i.e. cell dissociation, isolation, sorting, attachment and proliferation). The most effective and reproducible techniques were combined to consolidate culture methods and generate uncontaminated coral cell cultures for ∼7 days (10 days maximum). The tests were conducted on scleractinian corals Pocillopora acuta of the same genotype to harmonize results and reduce variation linked to genetic diversity. The development of cell separation and identification methods in conjunction with further investigations into coral cell-type specific metabolic requirements will allow us to tailor growth media for optimized monocultures as a tool for studying essential reef-building coral traits such as symbiosis, wound healing and calcification at multiple scales. © 2021 Roger et al.

Coral reefs not only serve as one of the most charismatic and biodiverse ecosystems on our planet, but also maintain the human harvesting of natural resources and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people.

Meanwhile, the impacts of microplastics and nanoplastics on coral health and its potential mechanisms remain further studied. Herein, this review first summarized the current status of microplastics pollution in global coral reefs, especially included (i) abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in different media (e.g., seawater, sediment, corals), and (ii) possible sources of microplastics in reef regions. Furthermore, the main interaction mechanisms between microplastics and corals are highlighted. Following this, the direct or indirect impacts of microplastics on coral species are discussed. With the rapid increase of plastic consumption and background of pervasive global coral bleaching, research on marine microplastics must focus on the critical coral reef regions and include a comprehensive knowledge about the distribution, fate, and potential risks from an ecosystem perspective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Publisher: Elsevier B.V. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;ecological impact;environmental impact assessment;climate change;Coral reef;Coral Reefs;ecosystem;Ecosystem;Ecosystems;marine pollution;plastic;plastic waste;Plastics;Review;sea pollution;animal;Animals;human;Humans;Reefs;nonhuman;ecotoxicology;pollution exposure;risk assessment;Pollution;sea water;Anthozoa;microplastic;Microplastic;Microplastics;pollution effect;Coral;environmental protection;symbiosis;Porites;particle size;water contamination;Oceans and Seas;sea;sediment;coral bleaching;Coral bleaching;Acropora;analytic method;priority journal;heavy metal;ocean acidification;Coral reef systems;Distribution characteristics;ecosystem response;environmental temperature;Interaction mechanisms;light irradiance;microbial colonization;microplastic pollution;Plastic consumption;Pocillopora damicornis;polyetherurethan;polymer;polystyrene;Population distribution;Potential impacts;Potential mechanism;Terrestrial systems;water analysis;Ecotoxicological effects;Marine microplastic pollution,,

Humans rely on these coral reef ecosystems to provide significant ecological and economic resources; however, coral reefs are threatened by numerous local and global anthropogenic factors that cause significant environmental change. The interactions of these local and global human impacts may increase the rate of coral reef degradation. For example, there are many local influences (i.e., sedimentation and submarine groundwater discharge) that may exacerbate coral bleaching and mortality. Therefore, researchers and resource managers cannot limit their narratives and actions to mitigating a sole stressor. With the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, management strategies and restoration techniques need to account for the scale at which environmental change occurs. This review aims to outline the various local and global anthropogenic stressors threatening reef resiliency and address the recent disagreements surrounding present-day conservation practices. Unfortunately, there is no one solution to preserve and restore all coral reefs. Each coral reef region is challenged by numerous interactive stressors that affect its ecosystem response, recovery, and services in various ways. This review discusses, while global reef degradation occurs, local solutions should be implemented to efficiently protect the coral reef ecosystem services that are valuable to marine and terrestrial environments. © 2021, The Author(s).","Publisher: Springer Nature | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Ecosystems;Gas emissions;Greenhouse gases;Reefs;Restoration;Anthropogenic stressors;Conservation practices;Coral reef degradation;Discharge (fluid mechanics);Ecological and economic;Groundwater;Management strategies;Restoration techniques;Submarine groundwater discharge;Terrestrial environments;Environmental change;Ocean warming;Coral reefs;Human impacts;Ocean acidification;Anthozoa,,

Due to the impact of climate change, these organisms are in danger of dying out, mainly through the process of coral bleaching, which is the process by which zooxanthellae (algal endosymbionts) are expelled from their respective coral hosts, causing the coral to lose colour and become white. Coral bleaching has been linked to increases in sea surface temperatures as well as an increase in light intensity. We reviewed the different zooxanthellae taxa and their ecological traits, as well as the information available on the protective mechanisms present in zooxanthellae cells when they experience environmental stress conditions, such as temperature fluctuations, specifically concentrating on heat shock proteins and their response to antioxidant stress. The eight clades (A-H) previously recognised were reorganised into seven existing genera. Different zooxanthellae taxa exhibit different ecological traits such as their photosynthetic stress responses to light and temperature. Zooxanthellae have the ability to regulate the number and type of heat shock proteins (Hsps) they produce during a heat response. They can also regulate the host's respective Hsps. Antioxidant responses that can prevent coral hosts from expelling the zooxanthellae, can be found both within exposed coral tissue and the zooxanthellae cells. Despite the lower likelihood of bleaching in South African coral reefs, genetic engineering presents a useful tool to understand and adapt traits within zooxanthellae genotypes to help mitigate coral bleaching in the future. © 2021 Academy of Science of South Africa.

Recent research highlights the importance of reducing CO2 emissions in combination with implementing local management actions to support reef health and recovery, particularly actions that protect sites which are more resilient to extreme events. Resilience assessments quantify the ecological, social, and environmental context of reefs through the lens of resilience, i.e., the capacity of a system to absorb or withstand stressors such that the system maintains its structure and functions and has the capacity to adapt to future disturbances and changes. Resilience assessments are an important tool to help marine managers and decision makers anticipate changes, identify areas with high survival prospects, and prioritize management actions to support resilience. While being widely implemented, however, there has not yet been an evaluation of whether resilience assessments have informed coral reef management. Here, we assess the primary and gray literature and input from coral reef managers to map where resilience assessments have been conducted. We explore if and how they have been used to inform management actions and provide recommendations for improving the likelihood that resilience assessments will result in management actions and positive conservation outcomes. These recommendations are applicable to other ecosystems in which resilience assessments are applied and will become increasingly important as climate impacts intensify and reduce the window of opportunity for protecting natural ecosystems. © 2020 The Author(s)","Publisher: Academic Press | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;management practice;climate change;Climate change;Climate Change;Coral reef;Coral Reefs;ecosystem;Ecosystem;animal;Animals;human;Monitoring;review;Anthozoa;environmental protection;conservation management;Conservation of Natural Resources;climate effect;manager;survival;ecosystem resilience;grey literature;probability;Probability;Coral reef management;Resilience assessment,,

The heat-induced breakdown of the symbiosis between the host and its dinoflagellate algae (that is, “bleaching”), is one of the most devastating outcomes for reef ecosystems. Yet, bleaching tolerance has been observed in some coral species. This review provides an overview of the holobiont’s diversity, explores coral thermal tolerance in relation to their associated microorganisms, discusses the hypothesis of adaptive dysbiosis as a mechanism of environmental adaptation, mentions potential solutions to mitigate bleaching, and suggests new research avenues. More specifically, we define coral bleaching as the succession of three holobiont stages, where the microbiota can (i) maintain essential functions for holobiont homeostasis during stress and/or (ii) act as a buffer to mitigate bleaching by favoring the recruitment of thermally tolerant Symbiodiniaceae species (adaptive dysbiosis), and where (iii) environmental stressors exceed the buffering capacity of both microbial and dinoflagellate partners leading to coral death. © 2020 by the authors.

Distinguishing the process of symbiont loss from the thermal stress response may shed light on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in each process. This study examined physiological changes and global gene expression patterns associated with white patch syndrome (WPS) in Porites lobata, which manifests in localized bleaching independent of thermal stress. In addition, a meta-analysis of global gene expression studies in other corals and anemones was used to contrast differential regulation as a result of disease and thermal stress from patterns correlated with symbiotic state. Symbiont density, chlorophyll a content, holobiont productivity, instant calcification rate, and total host protein content were uniformly reduced in WPS relative to healthy tissue. While expression patterns associated with WPS were secondary to fixed effects of source colony, specific functional enrichments combined with a lack of immune regulation suggest that the viral infection putatively giving rise to this condition affects symbiont rather than host cells. Expression in response to WPS also clustered independently of patterns in white syndrome impacted A. hyacinthus, further supporting a distinct aetiology of this syndrome. Expression patterns in WPS-affected tissues were significantly correlated with prior studies that examined short-term thermal stress responses independent of symbiotic state, suggesting that the majority of expression changes reflect a nonspecific stress response. Across studies, the magnitude and direction of expression change among particular functional enrichments suggests unique responses to stressor duration and highlights distinct responses to bleaching in an anemone model. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd","Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,CEESAT done,meta-analysis",,bleaching;coral;symbiosis;meta-analysis;Porites lobata;Tag-Seq;Gene Expression;European Continental Ancestry Group,,

Coral polyp tissues are rich in lipids. Currently, information on the composition of fatty acids and classes of coral lipid is reviewed. However, each lipid class represents a complex spectrum of molecular species of lipids, which is defined as the lipidome of a biological system. Scientific publications on human and higher terrestrial animal lipidomes exceed those on the lipidome of marine organisms by two orders of magnitude, and the data on coral lipidomes are very scattered. The existence of symbiotic coral species is completely dependent on the presence of intracellular microalgae (zooxanthellae), the loss of which is called coral bleaching and leads to the death of the entire coral reef. The bleaching causes significant changes in the lipid profile of corals. This paper summarizes information on the composition of common lipids, fatty acids, and molecules of polar and nonpolar lipid classes of octocoral and hexacoral polyps and their symbionts. We discuss general mechanisms of coral bleaching and show the importance of lipid indicators in the study of this process.

Coastal development and runoff lead to sedimentation, which directly impacts coral recruitment, growth, mortality, and the ecosystem services that coral reefs provide.

In response to needs identified by reef managers, we plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that will explore the effects of both deposited and suspended sediment on corals to identify single and interacting stressor thresholds. We will identify levels of sediment exposure (i.e., concentration, duration, and frequency) that cause adverse physical, physiological, behavioral, developmental, and ecological responses in coral and describe geographic and taxonomic patterns in these responses. Our ultimate goal is to provide managers with sediment exposure thresholds that can be expected to cause these responses. Methods: Our systematic review will synthesize available evidence on the effects of suspended and deposited sediment on corals. The research questions were formulated with an advisory team to support management decisions concerning local reef stressors in waters under U.S. federal jurisdiction. While the advisory team is most concerned with reefs adjacent to U.S. Pacific Islands, our review will include studies that examine reef-building coral species around the world. We will search online databases and grey literature to obtain a list of potential studies, assess their relevance, and critically appraise them for validity and risk of bias. Provided enough data can be extracted from relevant experimental studies, we will conduct meta-analyses that examine changes in coral health and survival in response to suspended and/or deposited sediment, with the goal to define sediment thresholds for reef managers. If enough data are available from within the U.S. Pacific Islands, we will construct region-, site-, and/or species-specific thresholds to improve local management. © 2020 The Author(s).","Publisher: BioMed Central | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: PROTOCOL,extracted,meta-analysis,systematic review",,Bleaching;Mortality;Turbidity;Dredging;Sedimentation;Marine management;Regulatory processes;Sublethal physiology,,

However, there are often conflicting results in the literature that are difficult to resolve, which we hypothesize are a result of unintended biases, variation in experimental design, and underreporting of critical methodological information. Here, we reviewed 255 coral heat-stress experiments to (1) document where and when they were conducted and on which species, (2) assess variability in experimental design, and (3) quantify the diversity of response variables measured. First, we found that two-thirds of studies were conducted in only three countries, three coral species were more heavily studied than others, and only 4\% of studies focused on earlier life stages. Second, slightly more than half of all heat-stress exposures were less than 8 d in duration, only 17\% of experiments fed corals, and experimental conditions varied widely, including the level and rate of temperature increase, light intensity, number of genets used, and the length of acclimation period. In addition, 95\%, 55\%, and {\textgreater} 35\% of studies did not report tank flow conditions, light–dark cycle used, or the date of the experiment, respectively. Finally, we found that 21\% of experiments did not measure any bleaching phenotype traits, 77\% did not identify the Symbiodiniaceae endosymbiont, and the contribution of the coral host in the physiological response to heat-stress was often not investigated. This review highlights geographic, taxonomic, and heat-stress duration biases in our understanding of coral bleaching, and large variability in the reporting and design of heat-stress experiments that could account for some of the discrepancies in the literature. Development of some best practice recommendations for coral bleaching experiments could improve cross-studies comparisons and increase the efficiency of coral bleaching research at a time when it is needed most. © 2020, The Author(s).","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Anthozoa;coral bleaching;Coral bleaching;endosymbiont;Symbiodiniaceae;global climate;literature review;phenotype;experimental design;acclimation;physiological response;Bleaching experiment;Coral bleaching review;Coral heat-stress;Heat-stress experiment;Temperature experiment;Hot Temperature,,

This is despite the fact that minority habitat formers can provide critical complexity, food, and other services that underpin ecosystem biodiversity. Octocorals and anemones are found in marine and estuarine habitats across all climate zones. Despite their potentially important ecological roles, to date there have been few studies of their specific threats and stressors or attempts at their restoration. Here we review studies of the ecology of octocorals and anemones with a focus on threats and restoration. We identify many threats including habitat damage, collection and trade, disease, predation, pollution, and the most wide-spread – climate change. While evidence suggests that some octocorals and anemone populations may be more resilient to disturbances than stony corals because they often recruit and grow quickly, resilience is not guaranteed. Instead, resilience or susceptibility within this large group is likely to be site and species specific. We find that the loss of octocorals and anemones has been difficult to quantify as most species have no hard structures that remain following a mortality event. Only through long-term monitoring efforts have researchers been able to document change in these populations. Due to the increasing extent and severity of human impacts in marine ecosystems, restoration of habitat forming species is becoming increasingly necessary after disturbance events. To illustrate the challenges ahead for octocoral and anemone restoration, we present two examples of ongoing restoration efforts assessed against the International Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration. Restoration planning and implementation progress are documented for the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum and the temperate Australian cauliflower soft coral, Dendronephthya australis. This review and the detailed case studies demonstrate that while some octocorals and anemones can provide resilient habitat within reef systems, a greater research focus on their ecology, threats, and restoration potential is urgently required. © Copyright © 2020 Steinberg, Dafforn, Ainsworth and Johnston.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,sea anemone;soft coral;tropical;alcyonaceae;octocoral;temperate,,

This is of great concern, as coral reefs provide numerous ecosystem, economic and social services. Corals are also recognised as being amongst the strongest individual sources of natural atmospheric sulfur, through stress-induced emissions of dimethylsulfide (DMS). In the clean marine boundary layer, biogenic sulfates contribute to new aerosol formation and the growth of existing particles, with important implications for the radiative balance over the ocean. Evidence suggests that DMS is not only directly involved in the coral stress response, alleviating oxidative stress, but also may create an ""ocean thermostat"" which suppresses sea surface temperature through changes to aerosol and cloud properties. This review provides a summary of the current major threats facing coral reefs and describes the role of dimethylated sulfur compounds in coral ecophysiology and the potential influence on climate. The role of coral reefs as a source of climatically important compounds is an emerging topic of research; however the window of opportunity to understand the complex biogeophysical processes involved is closing with ongoing degradation of the world's coral reefs. The greatest uncertainty in our estimates of radiative forcing and climate change is derived from natural aerosol sources, such as marine DMS, which constitute the largest flux of oceanic reduced sulfur to the atmosphere.

Thus, budget state metrics can provide important information on a reef's growth potential and on the capacity of reefs to sustain key geo-ecological services such as habitat provision and coastal protection. Whilst various approaches for estimating carbonate budgets exist, census-based methods have gained recent interest because they quantify the contribution of different functional groups and taxa, and allow assessments of the links between changing reef ecology and budget states.

However, the symbiotic system is complex, so the steady-state adjustment mechanisms of holobiont are not one-dimensional. Under multiple environmental pressures, the ecological behavior of holobiont is complex and variable, some basic theories lack a general consensus.

Microbial metabolism causes steep physico-chemical gradients in the skeleton, creating micro-niches that, along with dispersal limitation and priority effects, define the fine-scale microbial community assembly. Coral bleaching causes drastic changes in the skeletal microbiome, which can mitigate bleaching effects and promote coral survival during stress periods, but may also have detrimental effects.

We analyze the RCP8.5 ensemble of the Community Earth System Model v1.2 to identify monthly-to-decadal trends in Gulf of Mexico SST. Secondly, we examine projected changes in ocean pH, carbonate saturation state, and salinity in the same coupled model simulations. We find that the joint impacts of predicted higher temperatures and changes in ocean acidification will severely degrade Gulf of Mexico reef systems by the end of the twenty-first century.

Land-based sources of pollution are a critical threat to coral reefs, and understanding “ridge-to-reef” changes is urgently needed to improve management and coral survival in the Anthropocene. We review existing literature on spatial-ecological connections between land use and coral health, specifically examining vegetative, agricultural, urban, and other land-use types. In general, forested land use is positively related to metrics of coral condition, while anthropogenic land uses like urban development and agriculture drive a decline in coral cover, diversity, colony size, and structural complexity. However, land-use and land-cover impacts vary across time and space, and small portions of the landscape (e.g., discrete segments of unpaved roads, grazed and scalded hillsides) may have an outsized effect on reef pollution, presenting opportunities for targeted conservation. Some coral species show resilience under land-use and land-cover change, and the impact of land use on coral recovery from bleaching remains an active area of research. Finally, a spatial bibliography of existing literature reveals that most ridge-to-reef studies focus on a handful of regional hotspots, surface water, and watershed-scale dynamics; more research is needed to address groundwater connectivity and to compare land-use impacts across multiple regions and scales.

Although coral reefs are unlikely to persist in their current form unless climate change can be addressed, local management can have a role to play by extending the time frame over which there are functional reef systems capable of recovery. Here we consider the potential application of one form of local management – management of herbivorous fishes. The premise behind this approach is that increased herbivory could shift reef algal assemblages to states that are benign or beneficial for corals, thereby increasing corals’ ability to recover from destructive events such as bleaching and to thrive in periods between events. With a focus on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, we review what is known about the underlying processes of herbivory and coral-algal competition that ultimately affect the ability of corals to grow, persist, and replenish themselves. We then critically assess evidence of effectiveness or otherwise of herbivore management within marine protected areas (MPAs) to better understand why many MPAs have not improved outcomes for corals, and more importantly to identify the circumstances in which that form of management would be most likely to be effective. Herbivore management is not a panacea, but has the potential to enhance coral reef persistence in the right circumstances. Those include that: (i) absent management, there is an “algal problem” – i.e., insufficient herbivory to maintain algae in states that are benign or beneficial for corals; and (ii) management actions are able to increase net herbivory. As increased corallivory is a potentially widespread negative consequence of management, we consider some of the circumstances in which that is most likely to be a problem as well as potential solutions. Because the negative effects of certain algae are greatest for coral settlement and early survivorship, it may be that maintaining sufficient herbivory is particularly important in promoting recovery from destructive events such as mass bleaching. Thus, herbivore management can have a role to play as part of a wider strategy to manage and reduce the threats that currently imperil coral reefs. © Copyright © 2019 Williams, Kindinger, Couch, Walsh, Minton and Oliver.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;herbivory;algae;parrotfish;marine protected areas;Indo-Pacific;coral resilience,,

Current efforts focus not only on examining the consequences of heat stress on corals but also on finding strategies to potentially improve thermal tolerance and aid coral reefs survival in future climate scenarios. Although initial studies were limited in comparison with modern technological tools, they provided the foundation for many of today's research methods and hypotheses.

Coral bleaching is predominantly attributed to photo-oxidative stress, yet nutrient availability and metabolism underpin the stability of symbioses. Recent studies link symbiont proliferation under nutrient enrichment to bleaching; however, the interactions between nutrients and symbiotic stability are nuanced. Here, we demonstrate how bleaching is regulated by the forms and ratios of available nutrients and their impacts on autotrophic carbon metabolism, rather than algal symbiont growth. By extension, historical nutrient conditions mediate host–symbiont compatibility and bleaching tolerance over proximate and evolutionary timescales.

To maintain reefs in a net growth or net-neutral condition, curbing the impact of OA is therefore necessary. A variety of mitigation and adaptation strategies have been proposed to abate OA impacts on reefs. However, detailed guidance for managers on the types, effectiveness, or costs of different local interventions to address OA is scarce. To advance the discussion about available interventions, this review explores and compares mitigation and adaptation techniques that have been proposed to abate OA impacts on coral reefs. We focus primarily on four categories of interventions intended to address different ecosystem service changes: phytoremediation, chemical remediation, reef restoration, and assisted evolution. We briefly touch on traditional restoration methods like marine protected areas (MPAs) and reducing secondary sources of stress. Of the techniques reviewed, most are costly and do not scale at the same pace as global reef loss. Nor do they address the root cause of OA, global carbon emissions. That said, intervention should not be an all or nothing approach; some techniques may be worth implementing at smaller scales in a coordinated way. Working to save pieces of ecosystems and buying time may help ensure that there is more to rebuild from in the future. Despite the seemingly high price tag of many of these techniques, given the potential value of regained ecosystem services, net gains may exceed implementation costs. It is certain, however, from the limited reach of coral reef interventions, that they must be undertaken as part of a suite of global-scale interventions including atmospheric CO 2 reduction to preserve coral reef ecosystem function and benefits to humanity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Publisher: Elsevier B.V. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,,,

Accumulating evidence demonstrates differential resistance to bleaching among coral-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships; encouraging studies on the diversity and phylogenetics of Symbiodiniaceae. Examination of the existing knowledge reveals insights into both longitudinal and latitudinal partitioning of members of Symbiodiniaceae at genus level, throughout the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Contrary to expectations, due to decreasing sea surface temperature with latitude, this review has revealed an increase of polymorphic symbioses involving bleaching susceptible coral genera with latitude. This could partly explain the low impacts of bleaching episodes in the South Western Indian Ocean. In order to substantiate this, we suggest long term monitoring of coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbioses in the WIO region.

Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate.

Corallivores often prey on corals repeatedly, and this predation induces wounds that require extensive cellular resources to heal. The effects of corallivory on coral growth, reproduction, and community dynamics are well-documented, and often result in reduced growth rates and fitness. Given the degree of anthropogenic pressures that threaten coral reefs, it is now imperative to focus on understanding how corallivory interacts with anthropogenic forces to alter coral health and community dynamics. For example, coral bleaching events that stem from global climate change often reduce preferred corals species for many corallivorous fishes. These reductions in preferred prey may result in declines in populations of more specialized corallivores while more generalist corallivores may increase. Corallivory may also make corals more susceptible to thermal stress and exacerbate bleaching. At local scales, overfishing depletes corallivorous fish stocks, reducing fish corallivory and bioerosion, whilst removing invertivorous fishes and allowing population increases in invertebrate corallivores (e.g., urchins, Drupella spp.). Interactive effects of local stressors, such as overfishing and nutrient pollution, can alter the effect of corallivory by increasing coral-algal competition and destabilizing the coral microbiome, subsequently leading to coral disease and mortality. Here, we synthesize recent literature of how global climate change and local stressors affect corallivore populations and shape the patterns and effect of corallivory. Our review indicates that the combined effects of corallivory and anthropogenic pressures may be underappreciated and that these interactions often drive changes in coral reefs on scales from ecosystems to microbes. Understanding the ecology of coral reefs in the Anthropocene will require an increased focus on how anthropogenic forcing alters biotic interactions, such as corallivory, and the resulting cascading effects on corals and reef ecosystems. © 2019 Rice, Ezzat and Burkepile.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,overfishing;global climate change;Acanthaster spp.;butterflyflshes;corallivory;nutrient pollution;parrotfishes,,

However, in a literature review, we find little empirical support for the notion of managed resilience. We outline some reasons for why marine protected areas and the protection of herbivorous fish (especially parrotfish) have had little effect on coral resilience. One key explanation is that the impacts of local stressors (e.g., pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by the managed-resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local actions alone, then it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by directly addressing anthropogenic climate change - the root cause of global coral decline. © Copyright 2019 by Annual Reviews.

Thus, the future of corals and coral reefs in any given community and coral-Symbiodiniaceae associations over time will depend on their level of resilience, from individual corals to entire ecosystems. Herein we review the environmental settings and long-term ecological research on coral reefs, based on both coral resilience and space, in Kenting National Park (KNP), Hengchun Peninsula, southern Taiwan, wherein fringing reefs have developed along the coast of both capes and a semi-closed bay, known as Nanwan, within the peninsula. These reefs are influenced by a branch of Kuroshio Current, the monsoon-induced South China Sea Surface Current, and a tide-induced upwelling that not only shapes coral communities, but also reduces the seawater temperature and creates fluctuating thermal environments which over time have favoured thermal-resistant corals, particularly those corals close to the thermal effluent of a nuclear power plant in the west Nanwan. Although living coral cover (LCC) has fluctuated through time in concordance with major typhoons and coral bleaching between 1986 and 2019, spatial heterogeneity in LCC recovery has been detected, suggesting that coral reef resilience is variable among subregions in KNP. In addition, corals exposed to progressively warmer and fluctuating thermal environments show not only a dominance of associated, thermally-tolerant Durusdinium spp. but also the ability to shuffle their symbiont communities in response to seasonal variations in seawater temperature without bleaching. We demonstrate that coral reefs in a small geographical range with unique environmental settings and ecological characteristics, such as the KNP reef, may be resilient to bleaching and deserve novel conservation efforts. Thus, this review calls for conservation efforts that use resilience-based management programs to reduce local stresses and meet the challenge of climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Publisher: MDPI AG | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,community dynamics;coral reef;Symbiodiniaceae;Taiwan;nuclear power plant;long-term ecological data;marine national park;Coral Reefs;Anthozoa,,

Since the first descriptions of anomalous signs, we have come to understand multiple processes and environmental drivers that interact with coral pathologies. In order to gain a better insight into the knowledge we already have, we explored how key topics in coral disease research have been related to each other using network analysis. We reviewed 719 papers and conference proceedings published from 1965 to 2017. From each study, four elements determined our network nodes: (1) studied disease(s); (2) host genus; (3) marine ecoregion(s) associated with the study site; and (4) research objectives. Basic properties of this network confirmed that there is a set of specific topics comprising the majority of research. The top five diseases, genera, and ecoregions studied accounted for over 48\% of the research effort in all cases. The community structure analysis identified 15 clusters of topics with different degrees of overlap among them. These clusters represent the typical sets of elements that appear together for a given study. Our results show that while some coral diseases have been studied considering multiple aspects, the overall trend is for most diseases to be understood under a limited range of approaches, e.g., bacterial assemblages have been considerably studied in Yellow and Black band diseases while immune response has been better examined for the aspergillosis-Gorgonia system.

Although resilience-based management is now well established theoretically, there have been few examples of implementation. In Hawai‘i, back-to-back bleaching events in 2014 and 2015 caused significant damage motivating the state to seek guidance on next steps for recovery. Hawai‘i is a unique case study in distilling global recommendations to place-based action because of its ecological and social diversity. This study conducted a systematic review of literature using a weighted point system to evaluate and rank twelve potential Hawai‘i-specific interventions to promote coral recovery following a bleaching event. Papers were scored based on their ability to achieve their management objective as well as their ability to directly affect coral recovery. A total of 100 papers were included in the review which varied in their scale (multi-site or case study), location (inside or outside of Hawai‘i), and type of data collected (theoretical or empirical). Establishing a network of herbivore management areas ranked the highest followed by parrotfish size limits for action that could promote recovery in Hawai‘i.

Bleaching may result from evolutionary conflict between the host corals and their symbionts. Selection at the level of the individual symbiont favors using the products of photosynthesis for selfish replication, while selection at the higher level favors using these products for growth of the entire host/symbiont community. To hold the selfish lower-level units in check, mechanisms of conflict mediation must evolve. Fundamental features of photosynthesis have been co-opted into conflict mediation so that symbionts that fail to export these products produce high levels of reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. These mechanisms function very well under most environmental conditions, but under conditions particularly detrimental to photosynthesis, it is these mechanisms of conflict mediation that trigger bleaching. © 2018 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,bleaching;Review;animal;Animals;coral;nonhuman;Anthozoa;reactive oxygen metabolite;metabolism;microbiology;physiology;photosynthesis;symbiosis;symbiont;dinoflagellate;Symbiosis;Dinoflagellida;Genetic;apoptosis;Biological Evolution;evolution;Reactive Oxygen Species;Photosynthesis;bioremediation;conflict;genetic selection;host;Selection,,

Here we synthesize recent findings to develop a new perspective on coral−symbiont transmission and explore the relevance of these findings to the development of novel coral reef conservation and management tools. Evidence of diversity in Symbiodinium communities among juvenile corals can be attributed to variation in the host genotype acquired. This highlights the importance of inheriting a genetic architecture for regulating Symbiodinium community composition that is flexible enough to respond to changing environmental conditions. Emerging evidence from 8 species now exists that the strength and fidelity of coral−Symbiodinium associations differ from current paradigms based on host reproductive and symbiont transmission mode. This evidence supports that rapid adaptive responses of the holobiont through variations in Symbiodinium community structure are possible. Importantly, evidence of heritable variation in Symbiodinium communities indicates that adaptation through natural selection on this community is possible and that the strength of the response will depend on estimates of both heritability and phenotypic variance. We also present a novel analysis applying these results to quantitative genetic theory to model manipulative adaptive shifts. In combination, recent heritability estimates (h2) reviewed here highlight that inheritance of genes for regulating Symbiodinium community structure represents a previously unquantified mechanism by which juvenile corals may adapt to increasing environmental pressures, particularly those due to climate change. © Inter-Research 2018.","Publisher: Inter-Research | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;Coral reef;Anthozoa;environmental conditions;host-symbiont interaction;conservation status;restoration ecology;adaptation;Adaptation;heritability;natural selection;coral bleaching;community composition;Coral bleaching;Symbiosis;community structure;phenotype;genotype;knowledge;Symbiodinium,,

Increasing sea surface temperatures associated with global warming are a particular threat, as corals grow close to their upper thermal limit. When this limit is exceeded for a sufficient length of time during thermal stress events, corals lose their algal symbionts, resulting in coral bleaching and possible mortality. Coral reefs have experienced the most severe and extended global bleaching event to date from 2014 to 2017. The most recent global climate models predict that similar global bleaching events are likely to become an annual occurrence by the middle of the present century. Current understanding of coral reef recovery following disturbance events is based around decadal to sub-decadal impacts, making the adaptive capacity of corals as bleaching events approach an annual frequency unknown. However, there is considerable spatial heterogeneity in bleaching impacts across a range of scales, from global reef provinces to local reef areas and between coral species. Understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this observed coral resilience to thermal stress is increasing in a variety of disciplines, with particular recent advances at the sub-cellular level, facilitated partly by technological developments. This understanding suggests that some resilience factors have the potential to operate within the predicted annual frequency of thermal stress events, whilst others act over longer time-scales. The ability of coral reef management actions to successfully support coral resilience is a significant challenge and requires increased empirical evidence to support and refine actions. However, in addition to essential global actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, protective actions can be strengthened by a focus on identifying reef locations that have the potential to exhibit resilience to thermal stress events, either via resisting them or recovering quickly following impact. Here, we present a spatially explicit overview of the potential resilience factors and mechanisms that can be considered in such an approach. © 2018, The Author(s).","Publisher: Springer | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,check full text",,Climate change;Coral bleaching;Microbiome;Thermal stress;Coral reefs;Spatial resilience,,

In vitro experiments have been fundamental in providing insight into how reef organisms will potentially respond to future climates. However, such experiments are inevitably limited in their ability to reproduce the complex interactions that govern reef systems. Studies examining coral communities that already persist under naturally-occurring extreme and marginal physicochemical conditions have therefore become increasingly popular to advance ecosystem scale predictions of future reef form and function, although no single site provides a perfect analog to future reefs. Here we review the current state of knowledge that exists on the distribution of corals in marginal and extreme environments, and geographic sites at the latitudinal extremes of reef growth, as well as a variety of shallow reef systems and reef-neighboring environments (including upwelling and CO2 vent sites). We also conduct a synthesis of the abiotic data that have been collected at these systems, to provide the first collective assessment on the range of extreme conditions under which corals currently persist. We use the review and data synthesis to increase our understanding of the biological and ecological mechanisms that facilitate survival and success under sub-optimal physicochemical conditions. This comprehensive assessment can begin to: (i) highlight the extent of extreme abiotic scenarios under which corals can persist, (ii) explore whether there are commonalities in coral taxa able to persist in such extremes, (iii) provide evidence for key mechanisms required to support survival and/or persistence under sub-optimal environmental conditions, and (iv) evaluate the potential of current sub-optimal coral environments to act as potential refugia under changing environmental conditions. Such a collective approach is critical to better understand the future survival of corals in our changing environment. We finally outline priority areas for future research on extreme and marginal coral environments, and discuss the additional management options they may provide for corals through refuge or by providing genetic stocks of stress tolerant corals to support proactive management strategies. © 2018 Camp, Schoepf, Mumby, Hardtke, Rodolfo-Metalpa, Smith and Suggett.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.

For reef-building corals, understanding the relative roles of acclimatization and adaptation in generating thermal tolerance is fundamental to predicting the response of coral populations to future climate change. The temperature mosaic in the lagoon of Ofu, American Samoa, represents an ideal natural laboratory for studying thermal tolerance in corals. Two adjacent back-reef pools approximately 500 m apart have different temperature profiles: the highly variable (HV) pool experiences temperatures that range from 24.5 to 35°C, whereas the moderately variable (MV) pool ranges from 25 to 32°C. Standardized heat stress tests have shown that corals native to the HV pool have consistently higher levels of bleaching resistance than those in the MV pool. In this review, we summarize research into the mechanisms underlying this variation in bleaching resistance, focusing on the important reef-building genus Acropora. Both acclimatization and adaptation occur strongly and define thermal tolerance differences between pools. Most individual corals shift physiology to become more heat resistant when moved into the warmer pool. Lab based tests show that these shifts begin in as little as a week and are equally sparked by exposure to periodic high temperatures as constant high temperatures. Transcriptome-wide data on gene expression show that a wide variety of genes are co-regulated in expression modules that change expression after experimental heat stress, after acclimatization, and even after short term environmental fluctuations. Population genetic scans show associations between a corals' thermal environment and its alleles at 100s to 1000s of nuclear genes and no single gene confers strong environmental effects within or between species. Symbionts also tend to differ between pools and species, and the thermal tolerance of a coral is a reflection of individual host genotype and specific symbiont types. We conclude the review by placing this work in the context of parallel research going on in other species, reefs, and ecosystems around the world and into the broader framework of reef coral resilience in the face of climate change. © Copyright © 2018 Thomas, Rose, Bay, López, Morikawa, Ruiz-Jones and Palumbi.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,acclimatization;Acropora;phenotypic plasticity;coral reefs;thermal tolerance;polygenic adaptation;Cereals,,

Despite reports of extensive coral bleaching and up to 97\% coral mortality induced by El Niño events, a quantitative synthesis of the nature, intensity, and drivers of El Niño and La Niña impacts on corals is lacking. Herein, we first present a global meta-analysis of studies quantifying the effects of El Niño/La Niña-warming on corals, surveying studies from both the primary literature and International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) Proceedings. Overall, the strongest signal for El Niño/La Niña-associated coral bleaching was long-term mean temperature; bleaching decreased with decreasing long-term mean temperature (n = 20 studies). Additionally, coral cover losses during El Niño/La Niña were shaped by localized maximum heat stress and long-term mean temperature (n = 28 studies). Second, we present a method for quantifying coral heat stress which, for any coral reef location in the world, allows extraction of remotely-sensed degree heating weeks (DHW) for any date (since 1982), quantification of the maximum DHW, and the time lag since the maximum DHW. Using this method, we show that the 2015/16 El Niño event instigated unprecedented global coral heat stress across the world’s oceans. With El Niño events expected to increase in frequency and severity this century, it is imperative that we gain a clear understanding of how these thermal stress anomalies impact different coral species and coral reef regions. We therefore finish with recommendations for future coral bleaching studies that will foster improved syntheses, as well as predictive and adaptive capacity to extreme warming events. © 2018 Claar et al.

In contrast to the holobionts of reef-building scleractinian corals, the holobionts of octocorals have received relatively little attention, despite the devastating effects of disease outbreaks on many populations. Recent advances have shown that octocorals possess remarkably stable bacterial communities on geographical and temporal scales as well as under environmental stress. This may be the result of their high capacity to regulate their microbiome through the production of antimicrobial and quorum-sensing interfering compounds. Despite decades of research relating to octocoral-microbe interactions, a synthesis of this expanding field has not been conducted to date. We therefore provide an urgently needed review on our current knowledge about octocoral holobionts. Specifically, we briefly introduce the ecological role of octocorals and the concept of holobiont before providing detailed overviews of (I) the symbiosis between octocorals and the algal symbiont Symbiodinium; (II) the main fungal, viral, and bacterial taxa associated with octocorals; (III) the dominance of the microbial assemblages by a few microbial species, the stability of these associations, and their evolutionary history with the host organism; (IV) octocoral diseases; (V) how octocorals use their immune system to fight pathogens; (VI) microbiome regulation by the octocoral and its associated microbes; and (VII) the discovery of natural products with microbiome regulatory activities. Finally, we present our perspectives on how the field of octocoral research should move forward, and the recognition that these organisms may be suitable model organisms to study coral-microbe symbioses. © The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License","Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;Coral Reefs;ecosystem;Ecosystem;Review;animal;Animals;genetics;phylogeny;nonhuman;spatiotemporal analysis;Anthozoa;oxidative stress;phagocytosis;reactive oxygen metabolite;host pathogen interaction;Host-Pathogen Interactions;microbiology;symbiosis;biological product;Biological Products;classification;drug development;Drug Discovery;Paenibacillus;mass spectrometry;Bacteria;bacterium;microbial community;prevalence;RNA 16S;RNA sequence;Symbiosis;microbiome;priority journal;microbial diversity;animal disease;pH;fungus;Microbiota;microflora;superoxide dismutase;Symbiodinium;time of flight mass spectrometry;Spatio-Temporal Analysis;Fungi;Immunity;immunology;virus;Microbiome;Viruses;immune response;transcriptome;Animal Diseases;bacterial microbiome;Host Microbial Interactions;quorum sensing;Holobiont;Octocoral;Gorgonians;Soft coral,,

However, environmental changes often cause compositional and functional shifts in microbial communities that can have flow-on consequences for microbial-mediated processes. These microbial alterations may impact the health of specific host organisms and can have repercussions for the functioning of entire coral ecosystems. Assessing changes in reef microbial communities should therefore provide an early indicator of ecosystem impacts and would underpin the development of diagnostic tools that could help forecast shifts in coral reef health under different environmental states. Monitoring, management and active restoration efforts have recently intensified and diversified in response to global declines in coral reef health. Here we propose that regular monitoring of coral reef microorganisms could provide a rapid and sensitive platform for identifying declining ecosystem health that can complement existing management frameworks. By summarising the most common threats to coral reefs, with a particular focus on the Great Barrier Reef, and elaborating on the role of microbes in coral reef health and ecosystem stability, we highlight the diagnostic applicability of microbes in reef management programs.

Here, this chain of evidence is reviewed for Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and its catchments. Excessive sediment delivery to the marine environment is one component of an interlinked group of stressors that include coral bleaching, damage by storms, and plagues of crown-of-thorns starfish. Sediment and the pollutants they carry are one of the drivers of marine ecosystem decline and adversely impact recovery following disturbance by other stressors. Significantly, a portion of the N species carried by fine sediment in the freshwater system is released in the marine environment, thereby perturbing marine ecology. Available controls on sediment and pollutant delivery are hillslope erosion rates, gully and streambank erosion rates, sediment deposition rates in sediment sinks including footslopes, floodplains, and water reservoirs, and the application rates of pesticides and fertilizers. By reducing sediment fluxes through the combined strategies of erosion control and deposition enhancement, near- and offshore impacts can be reduced. Gully and streambank erosion are more significant sources of fine sediment than hillslope erosion. Fertilizer and non-fertilizer N and pesticides carried by sediment play an important role in coral reef degradation. A graphic summary of the spatial configuration the sources and sinks is provided to guide the prioritization of interventions.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes are essential symbionts and mutualists, nonpathogenic invaders, primary pathogens, have been linked to disease emergence, and can underpin broader ecosystem changes. However, in the effort to determine coral–microbial interactions, the structure and function of the eukaryotic microbes of the microbiome have been studied less. Eukaryotic microbes are important members of the microbiome, constitute entire kingdoms of life, and make important contributions to ecosystem function. Here, we outline the roles of eukaryotic microbes in marine systems and their contribution to ecosystem change, and discuss the microeukaryotic microbiome of corals and coral reefs. Current knowledge of the taxonomic diversity and functional contribution of the microeukaryotes within the coral and coral reef microbiome is limited. Microeukaryotes can function within ecosystems as pathogens, engineers, and symbionts; however, their functional role has been the primary focus of research to date. The microeukaryotes’ sources, sinks, and persistence – within and between habitats – have not yet been addressed. Coral reef molecular diversity studies predominantly remove microeukaryotes' data from datasets, and, in doing so, exclude these potentially key taxa from assessments of microbiome function.

Over 30 scleractinian coral species, about the same number as documented to date from nearby coral reefs, grow here. No other mangrove ecosystems in the Caribbean are known to have so many coral species. This area may be a refuge from changing climate, as these corals weathered the severe thermal stress and subsequent disease outbreak that caused major coral loss on the island's coral reefs in 2005 and 2006. Shading by the red mangrove trees reduces the stress that leads to coral bleaching. Seawater temperatures in these mangroves are more variable than those on the reefs, and some studies have shown that this variability results in corals with a greater resistance to higher temperatures.

Both are affected by ocean acidification (OA). We summarize definitions and concepts in bioerosion research and knowledge in the context of OA, providing case examples and meta-analyses. Chemically mediated bioerosion relies on energy demanding, biologically controlled undersaturation or acid regulation and increases with simulated OA, as does passive dissolution. Through substrate weakening both processes can indirectly enhance mechanical bioerosion, which is not directly affected by OA. The low attention and expert knowledge on bioerosion produced some ambiguous views and approaches, and limitations to experimental studies restricted opportunities to generalize. Comparability of various bioerosion and calcification rates remains difficult. Physiological responses of bioeroders or interactions of environmental factors are insufficiently studied. We stress the importance to foster and advance high quality bioerosion research as global trends suggest the following: (i) growing environmental change (eutrophication, coral mortality, OA) is expected to elevate bioerosion in the near future; (ii) changes harmful to calcifiers may not be as severe for bioeroders (e.g. warming); and (iii) factors facilitating bioerosion often reduce calcification rates (e.g. OA).

Despite the efforts to enhance and coordinate coral reef monitoring within and across countries, our knowledge of the geographic extent of mass coral bleaching over the past few decades is incomplete. Existing databases, like ReefBase, are limited by the voluntary nature of contributions, geographical biases in data collection, and the variations in the spatial scale of bleaching reports. In this study, we have developed the first-ever gridded, global-scale historical coral bleaching database. First, we conducted a targeted search for bleaching reports not included in ReefBase by personally contacting scientists and divers conducting monitoring in under-reported locations and by extracting data from the literature. This search increased the number of observed bleaching reports by 79\%, from 4146 to 7429. Second, we employed spatial interpolation techniques to develop annual 0.04×0.04 latitude-longitude global maps of the probability that bleaching occurred for 1985 through 2010. Initial results indicate that the area of coral reefs with a more likely than not ({\textgreater}50\%) or likely ({\textgreater}66\%) probability of bleaching was eight times higher in the second half of the assessed time period, after the 1997/ 1998 El Nio. The results also indicate that annual maximum Degree Heating Weeks, a measure of thermal stress, for coral reefs with a high probability of bleaching increased over time. The database will help the scientific community more accurately assess the change in the frequency of mass coral bleaching events, validate methods of predicting mass coral bleaching, and test whether coral reefs are adjusting to rising ocean temperatures. © 2017 Li et al.

However, an array of other microorganisms associated with coral (i.e., Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, and viruses) have a complex and intricate role in maintaining homeostasis between corals and Symbiodinium. Corals are sensitive to shifts in the surrounding environmental conditions. One of the most widely reported responses of coral to stressful environmental conditions is bleaching. During this event, corals expel Symbiodinium cells from their gastrodermal tissues upon experiencing extended seawater temperatures above their thermal threshold. An array of other environmental stressors can also destabilize the coral microbiome, resulting in compromised health of the host, which may include disease and mortality in the worst scenario. However, the exact mechanisms by which the coral microbiome supports coral health and increases resilience are poorly understood. Earlier studies of coral microbiology proposed a coral probiotic hypothesis, wherein a dynamic relationship exists between corals and their symbiotic microorganisms, selecting for the coral holobiont that is best suited for the prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we discuss the microbial-host relationships within the coral holobiont, along with their potential roles in maintaining coral health. We propose the term BMC (Beneficial Microorganisms for Corals) to define (specific) symbionts that promote coral health. This term and concept are analogous to the term Plant Growth Promoting Rhizosphere (PGPR), which has been widely explored and manipulated in the agricultural industry for microorganisms that inhabit the rhizosphere and directly or indirectly promote plant growth and development through the production of regulatory signals, antibiotics and nutrients. Additionally, we propose and discuss the potential mechanisms of the effects of BMC on corals, suggesting strategies for the use of this knowledge to manipulate the microbiome, reversing dysbiosis to restore and protect coral reefs. This may include developing and using BMC consortia as environmental ""probiotics"" to improve coral resistance after bleaching events and/or the use of BMC with other strategies such as human-assisted acclimation/adaption to shifting environmental conditions. © 2017 Peixoto, Rosado, Leite, Rosado and Bourne.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;Review;nonhuman;sea water;unclassified drug;dysbiosis;homeostasis;temperature;ammonia;nitrate;antibiotic agent;Symbiodinium;ecosystem resilience;plant growth;dimethylsulfoniopropionate;nutrient;quorum sensing;glucose;carbon cycling;concentration (parameters);inorganic compound;intracellular signaling;n acylhomoserine lactone;rhizosphere;tropodithietic acid,,

The property of resilience captures how reefs react and respond to stressors and environmental changes. Therefore, in principle, management goals are more likely to be realised if resilience theory is used to inform decision making and help set realistic expectations for reef outcomes. Indeed, a new approach to reef management has been termed 'resilience-based management' (RBM). Yet, resilience concepts have often been criticised for being vague, difficult to operationalise, and beset by multiple definitions. Here, we evaluate how the advent of RBM has changed one aspect of reef management: assessment and monitoring. We compare the metrics used in conventional monitoring programs with those developed through resilience assessments and find that the latter have a stronger focus on ecological processes and exposure to environmental drivers. In contrast, monitoring tends to focus on metrics of reef state and has greater taxonomic resolution, which provides comprehensive information on the nature of changes but does not predict the future responses of reefs in part because it is difficult to extrapolate statistical trends of complex ecological systems. In addition, metrics measured by resilience studies are more diverse, owing in part to the reliance of state metrics as proxies of processes given the difficulty in quantifying key ecological processes directly. We conclude by describing practical ways of improving resilience assessments, and avenues for future research. © 2017 Lam et al.

The development of next generation sequencing has allowed large data sets to be amassed describing the microbial communities of many organisms and the field of coral biology is no exception. However, the choices made in the analytical process and the interpretation of these data can significantly affect the outcome and the overall conclusions drawn. In this review we explore the implications of these difficulties, as well as highlighting analytical tools developed in other research fields (such as network analysis) which hold substantial potential in helping to develop a deeper understanding of the role of the microbiome in disease in corals.

The overgrowth of macroalgae in reef regions hampers the growth, reproduction and recovery of coral colonies, primarily because; (1) macroalgae compete with corals for space and light, lowering the growth rate of corals, causing death through suffocation and inhibiting the engraftment of coral larvaes; (2) macroalgae negatively affect corals growth via physical abrasion and the release of allelochemicals when in direct contact with corals; abrasion causes coral polyps to shrink and influences the ingestion behaviour and calcification of polyps, while the release of allelochemicals into the surrounding environment of corals may cause coral bleaching and the damage of coral tissue. (3) The reproduction of corals is a highly energy consuming process. Any outside pressure which may drain a coral’s stored energy will influence the fertility of the coral. In reef regions, the overgrowth of macroalgae breaks its competitive balance with corals, since, in response to the invasion of macroalgae, corals re-allocate energy needed for growth and reproduction to tissue repair and protection, causing a decrease in the quantity and quality of coral eggs, which decreases the energy allocated to reproduction; (4) The inhibiting effects of macroalgae on corals is the key factor to cause the degeneration of coral communities. Macroalgae influence the settlement and survival rate of coral larvas, thereby preventing the development of coral communities; (5) seaweeds accumulate sediments, release pathogens, and disrupt the growth of coral symbiotic microbes, indirectly influencing coral growth. This paper includes a brief overview of the primary competitive mechanisms (physical, chemical, and microbial) of macroalgae and corals. Understanding these competitive mechanisms will be very helpful when studying the interaction process between macroalgae and corals. We know much about the physical competition mechanisms, but the chemical and microbial mechanisms require more in-depth research; indeed, they are the hotspot of current research in coral reef sciences. In addition, this paper categorizes macroalgae according to their functional groups, lists the effects of three types of benthic seaweeds on corals, and summarizes the present status of coral reef degradation and the effect of macroalgae in areas with degraded reefs. Finally, it includes a review of the progress made by the latest research on the effect of macroalgae on corals, and suggests that our study should strengthen its research on the distribution and abundance of macroalgae species in the coral reef regions of the South China Sea in order to better evaluate the extent of macroalgae influence on the coral reefs of this region. Physiological, molecular, and ecological methods should be utilized to explore the mechanisms via which macroalgae influence corals at the cellular and molecular levels, in order to provide reference data for coral reef ecosystem conservation. © 2016 Ecological Society of China.

I review the ecological and evolutionary response of coral reefs to climate change in a broad temporal context, primarily focusing on tropical reef corals. I show critical gaps in our understanding that impede accurate prediction of future responses. These gaps include the response of past reefs to global change, the interpretation of coral response to thermal stress and ocean acidification, how corals and other reef organisms might respond evolutionarily, and our approach to evaluating response to climate in the context of multiple stressors. Reducing uncertainty by filling these gaps and by incorporating variation in geographic and taxonomic response will substantially improve our ability to model coral reef futures and manage coral reefs.

This review presents evidence that sewage discharge occurs in waters surrounding at least 104 of 112 reef geographies. Studies often refer to sewage as a single stressor. However, we show that it is more accurately characterized as a multiple stressor. Many of the individual agents found within sewage, specifically freshwater, inorganic nutrients, pathogens, endocrine disrupters, suspended solids, sediments, and heavy metals, can severely impair coral growth and/or reproduction. These components of sewage may interact with each other to create as-yet poorly understood synergisms (e.g., nutrients facilitate pathogen growth), and escalate impacts of other, non-sewage-based stressors. Surprisingly few published studies have examined impacts of sewage in the field, but those that have suggest negative effects on coral reefs. Because sewage discharge proximal to sensitive coral reefs is widespread across the tropics, it is imperative for coral reef-focused institutions to increase investment in threat-abatement strategies for mitigating sewage pollution. © 2015 The Authors.","Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Inc. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Environmental Monitoring;bleaching;coral reef;Coral Reefs;environmental stress;animal;Animals;human;Humans;nonhuman;Article;microbiology;endocrine disruptor;environmental monitoring;water pollution;chemistry;water quality;coastal waters;procedures;sewage;Sewage;legislation and jurisprudence;prevention and control;Water Pollution;microbial community;sediment;fresh water;eutrophication;alga;heavy metal;environmental policy;suspended particulate matter;pollution;reproduction;sedimentation;nutrient availability;Environmental Policy;adverse effects;geography;inorganic nutrient;sewage disposal;toxin,,

Given the present rates of reefs degradation, this value may be doubled in the nearest 30 years. For the essential part of coastal community, the destruction of coral ecosystems implies the loss of the major food sources, natural protection from storms, and significant (if not the only) revenue from exploi- tation of reefs especially in tourism industry. Finally, the disappearance of low-laying coral islands may threat the local communities by deprivation of living space. Global negative effects include temperature anomalies of sea surface waters and an increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration leading to ocean acidification. Local negative effects are related to in- crease of sedimentation and eutrophication, cyclone and storm passes, coral diseases, chemical pollution, mechanical destruction of corals by humans, anthropogenic depletion of functional groups of fish and invertebrates. An entire set of responses of coral ecosystems to stressful factors on the levels of both separate taxa and ecosystem is discussed. An analysis of published data suggests that with high probability the tropical coral communities will come to collapse stage by the middle of the current century at more than 50\% of the area of their biogeographic range, especially in the regions of dense human population. At the most optimistic scenario, complex effect of reviewed negative factors will result in coral ecosystems main- taining in some areas. However, after global transformations, these ecosystems will be dominated by the most resistant taxa, mainly massive and encrusting forms of long-lived species with low growth rates and high competitive ability. Among such taxa, Poritidae demonstrates the highest adaptive capability. At the most pessimistic scenario, scleractinian communities will be replaced by alternative communities of macroalgae and non-calcareous anthozoans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;Climate Change;Coral Reefs;animal;Animals;human;Humans;Anthozoa,,

Moreover, we summarized the important roles of irradiation, flow rate, nutrients, feed and other factors in coral propagation within recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). Irradiation is the key to successful ex situ coral culture and different species show different needs of radiation intensity and light spectrum. Therefore, artificial lighting in RAS, as well as power and maintenance costs, are very important for ex situ coral aquaculture. In addition, corals are very sensitive to NH4 +, NO3 -, NO2 - as well as phosphate in RAS, and many physical, chemical and biological methods are acquired to maintain low nutrients condition.

While climate change, specifically rising sea surface temperature, has been proposed as a major and growing driver of the emergence of marine diseases, to date a solid connection between disease epizootics and elevated sea surface temperature has not been established. However, a wealth of data now exists, compiled from many different perspectives, that may support such a connection. In this work we provide a comprehensive review targeting one coral disease, black band disease, that spans the infection process, pathobiology, and epizootiology, and links specific mechanisms of the disease process to increasing temperatures. This temperature-driven pattern of infection can be expanded to include similar processes associated with other temperature-related coral diseases. The conclusions presented here are based upon the results of many studies using a diverse suite of approaches that have been synthesized to argue that the emergence and continuing spread of black band disease is linked to warming sea surface temperatures. In summary, as global ocean temperatures increase seasonally and over decades, the environment shifts to become more favorable for the growth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms endemic to the immediate environment of the reef. The increase in the relative number of potential pathogens in the microbial community produces microenvironments conducive to the growth of other potential pathogens, leading to infection by a polymicrobial consortium. This consortium is easily perturbed by a (seasonal) temperature decrease, but remains associated with the coral host and can be reactivated with a subsequent seasonal increase in temperature, resulting in a cycle of temperature-dependent disease emergence. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;Anthozoa;sea surface temperature;cyanobacterium;pathology;microbial community;climate effect;Cyanobacteria;temperature effect;infectious disease;pathogen;infectivity;microbial mat;coral disease;cyanobacteria;Black band disease;elevated temperature,,

Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO2, resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;marine environment;Review;nonhuman;risk assessment;Anthozoa;environmental protection;acclimatization;adaptation;selective breeding;epigenetics;priority journal;evolutionary adaptation;ecosystem resilience;evolution;Animalia;ecosystem restoration;stress;DNA modification;genetic manipulation;life history trait;transgenic organism;microbial symbionts;transgenerational acclimatization,,

However, members of the Vibrio genus are prominent as causative agents of disease in corals. The aim of this chapter is to review our understanding of the spectrum of disease effects displayed by coral-associated vibrios, with a particular emphasis on the few species where detailed studies of pathogenicity have been conducted. The role of Vibrio shilonii in seasonal bleaching of Oculina patagonica and the development of the coral probiotic hypothesis is reviewed, pointing to unanswered questions about this phenomenon. Detailed consideration is given to studies of V. coralliilyticus and related pathogens and changes in the dominance of vibrios associated with coral bleaching. Other Vibrio-associated disease syndromes discussed include yellow band/blotch disease and tissue necrosis in temperate gorgonian corals. The review includes analysis of the role of enzymes, resistance to oxidative stress, and quorum sensing in virulence of coral-associated vibrios. The review concludes that we should probably regard most-possibly all-vibrios as ""opportunistic"" pathogens which, under certain environmental conditions, are capable of overwhelming the defense mechanisms of appropriate hosts, leading to rapid growth and tissue destruction. © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.

We hypothesize that inconsistent application of a complete diagnostic approach to coral disease has contributed to this slow progress. We quantified methods used to investigate coral disease in 492 papers published between 1965 and 2013. Field surveys were used in 65\% of the papers, followed by biodetection (43\%), laboratory trials (20\%), microscopic pathology (21\%), and field trials (9\%). Of the microscopic pathology efforts, 57\% involved standard histopathology at the light microscopic level (12\% of the total investigations), with the remainder dedicated to electron or fluorescence microscopy. Most (74\%) biodetection efforts focused on culture or molecular characterization of bacteria or fungi from corals. Molecular and immunological tools have been used to incriminate infectious agents (mainly bacteria) as the cause of coral diseases without relating the agent to specific changes in cell and tissue pathology. Of 19 papers that declared an infectious agent as a cause of disease in corals, only one (5\%) used microscopic pathology, and none fulfilled all of the criteria required to satisfy Koch’s postulates as applied to animal diseases currently. Vertebrate diseases of skin and mucosal surfaces present challenges similar to corals when trying to identify a pathogen from a vast array of environmental microbes, and diagnostic approaches regularly used in these cases might provide a model for investigating coral diseases.

Documenting variability and detecting change in global and regional climate relies upon high quality observational records of climate variables supplemented, prior to the mid-19th century, with reconstructions from various sources of proxy climate information. Here we review how annual density banding patterns that are recorded in the skeletons of massive reef-building corals have been used to document environmental change and impacts within coral reefs. Massive corals provide a historical perspective of continuous calcification processes that pre-date most ecological observations of coral reefs. High-density stress bands, abrupt declines in annual linear extension, and evidence of partial mortality within the skeletal growth record reveal signatures of catastrophic stress events that have recently been attributed to mass bleaching events caused by unprecedented thermal stress. Comparison of recent trends in annual calcification with century-scale baseline calcification rates reveals that the frequency of growth anomalies has increased since the late 1990s throughout most of the world's coral reef ecosystems. Continuous coral growth histories provide valuable retrospective information on the coral response to environmental change and the consequences of anthropogenic climate change.

We provide a comprehensive review of multiple stressor interactions in coral reef ecosystems, which are widely considered to be one of the most sensitive ecosystems to global change. First, we synthesized coral reef studies that examined interactions of two or more stressors, highlighting stressor interactions (where one stressor directly influences another) and potentially synergistic effects on response variables (where two stressors interact to produce an effect that is greater than purely additive). For stressor-stressor interactions, we found 176 studies that examined at least 2 of the 13 stressors of interest. Applying network analysis to analyze relationships between stressors, we found that pathogens were exacerbated by more costressors than any other stressor, with ca. 78\% of studies reporting an enhancing effect by another stressor. Sedimentation, storms, and water temperature directly affected the largest number of other stressors. Pathogens, nutrients, and crown-of-thorns starfish were the most-influenced stressors. We found 187 studies that examined the effects of two or more stressors on a third dependent variable. The interaction of irradiance and temperature on corals has been the subject of more research (62 studies, 33\% of the total) than any other combination of stressors, with many studies reporting a synergistic effect on coral symbiont photosynthetic performance (n = 19). Second, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of existing literature on this most-studied interaction (irradiance and temperature). We found that the mean effect size of combined treatments was statistically indistinguishable from a purely additive interaction, although it should be noted that the sample size was relatively small (n = 26). Overall, although in aggregate a large body of literature examines stressor effects on coral reefs and coral organisms, considerable gaps remain for numerous stressor interactions and effects, and insufficient quantitative evidence exists to suggest that the prevailing type of stressor interaction is synergistic. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,CEESAT done,meta-analysis",,coral reef;climate change;Climate Change;Coral Reefs;environmental stress;animal;Animals;review;Anthozoa;physiology;meta-analysis;Physiological;coral bleaching;overfishing;global climate;physiological stress;ecosystem response;Stress;nutrient;Acanthaster planci;temperature effect;Asteroidea;pathogen;irradiance,,

Oxidative stress is caused by environmental stressors such as those associated with global climate change, and ultimately leads to breakdown of the coral-algal symbiosis known as coral bleaching. Recently, large-scale coral bleaching events have become pervasive and frequent threatening and endangering coral reefs. Because the coral-algal symbiosis is the biological engine producing the reef, the future of coral reef ecosystems depends on the ecophysiology of the symbiosis. This review examines the photobiology of the coral-algal symbiosis with particular focus on the photophysiological responses and timescales of corals and Symbiodinium. Additionally, this review summarizes the light environment and its dynamics, the vulnerability of the symbiosis to oxidative stress, the abiotic and biotic factors influencing photosynthesis, the diversity of the coral-algal symbiosis, and recent advances in the field. Studies integrating physiology with the developing ""omics"" fields will provide new insights into the coral-algal symbiosis. Greater physiological and ecological understanding of the coral-algal symbiosis is needed for protection and conservation of coral reefs. © 2014 Roth.","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;Review;nonhuman;oxidative stress;photosynthesis;symbiosis;carotenoid;unclassified drug;population abundance;biodiversity;carbon;dinoflagellate;oxygen;carbon dioxide;calcification;antioxidant;Symbiodinium;amino acid;mycosporine like amino acid;pigment;fluorescent protein;acclimation;ecophysiology;light quality;peptides and proteins;photobiology;photochemical quenching;photosynthetic photon flux density;scleractinian corals;photophysiology;photoprotection,,

In the past few decades, corals reefs worldwide have been increasingly affected by coral bleaching (i.e., the breakdown of the symbiosis between corals and their dinoflagellate symbionts), which carries important socio-economic implications. Consequently, the number of studies focusing on the molecular and cellular processes underlying this biological phenomenon has grown rapidly, and symbiosis is now widely recognized as a major topic in coral biology. However, obtaining a clear image of the interplay between the environment and this mutualistic symbiosis remains challenging. Here, we review the potential of recent technological advances in molecular biology and approaches using stable isotopes to fill critical knowledge gaps regarding coral symbiotic function.

Currently, coral viability is threatened, due in part to the increased number of diseases affecting them in recent decades. Understanding how the innate immune systems of corals function is important if we want to predict the fate of corals and their response to the environmental and biological changes they face. In this review we discuss the latest findings regarding the innate immune systems of corals. The review is organized following the chronology of steps taken by corals from the initial encounter with a potential pathogen and recognition of threats to the orchestration of a response. We begin with the literature describing the repertory of immune-related receptors involved in the recognition of threats and the subsequent pathways leading to an immune response. We then review the effector responses that eliminate the threats described for corals. Finally, we acknowledge the literature of coral microbiology to access the potential role of microbes as an essential constituent of the coral immune system. © 2014 Universita degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia.

We focus on eight design principles from common-pool resource (CPR) theory and other key social-ecological systems governance variables, and explore to what extent they help explain the social and ecological outcomes of park management through time. Our analysis showed that commercial fisheries management and the re-zoning of the GBRMP in 2004 led to improvements in ecological condition of the reef, particularly fisheries. These boundary and rights changes were supported by effective monitoring, sanctioning and conflict resolution. Moderate biophysical connectivity was also important for improved outcomes. However, our analysis also highlighted that continued challenges to improved ecological health in terms of coral cover and biodiversity can be explained by fuzzy boundaries between land and sea, and the significance of external drivers to even large-scale social-ecological systems (SES).

Nested governance arrangements become even more important at this larger scale. To our knowledge, our paper provides the first analysis linking the re-zoning of the GBRMP to CPR and SES theory.

This review presents a summary of the known microbial functional genes that have been linked to coral health and disease. Overall functional gene diversity tended to be lower in healthy corals than diseased or bleached corals, and respiration and photosynthesis functional genes appeared to be crucial to coral health. Genes associated with the nitrogen cycle were the most studied, were highly represented within the coral holobiont, and their expression often shifted in diseased or stressed individuals. Carbon metabolism, such as fatty acid and amino acid catabolism, also tended to shift in unhealthy corals. Genes associated with sulfite respiration as well as dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation have been detected, although they have yet to be directly associated with coral disease. In addition, genes associated with xenobiotic degradation, antibiotic resistance, virulence, and oxidative stress may all be involved in maintaining coral health. However, the links between these functional genes and their roles in interacting with the coral host are not clear.

Furthermore, the data suggest that COTS activity has increased rapidly since 2000. Very little of this activity has been reported in the primary literature, and there is a general lack of awareness in Indonesia of COTS as a potential cause of reef degradation. This lack of awareness, combined with limited monitoring efforts, means that damage caused by COTS is often attributed to other causes, such as destructive fishing, bleaching or tsunami.

Current estimates of coral cover ranged between 3 and 44\% in coral habitats. Coral communities in the northern regions were dominated by corals from the families Acroporidae and Poritidae, which became less common at higher latitudes. At Ningaloo Reef coral cover has remained relatively stable through time (∼28\%), although north-eastern and southern areas have experienced significant declines in overall cover. These declines are likely related to periodic disturbances such as cyclones and thermal anomalies, which were particularly noticeable around 1998/1999 and 2010/2011. Linear mixed effects models (LME) suggest latitude explains 10\% of the deviance in coral cover through time at Ningaloo. Acroporidae has decreased in abundance relative to other common families at Ningaloo in the south, which might be related to persistence of more thermally and mechanically tolerant families.

Neither differences in carbonate chemistry manipulation method, study duration, irradiance level, nor study species growth rate explained a significant proportion of the among-study variation. However, studies employing buoyant weighting found significantly smaller decreases in calcification per unit ΩArag ( 10\%), compared with studies using the alkalinity anomaly technique ( 25\%). These differences may be due to the greater tendency for the former to integrate over light and dark calcification. If the existing body of experimental work is indeed representative of likely responses of corals in nature, our results imply that, under business as usual conditions, declines in coral calcification by end-of-century will be 22\%, on average, or 15\% if only studies integrating light and dark calcification are considered. These values are near the low end of published projections, but support the emerging view that variability due to local environmental conditions and species composition is likely to be substantial. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,CEESAT done,meta-analysis",,coral reef;climate change;animal;Animals;article;carbonate;Anthozoa;environmental conditions;physiology;chemistry;meta analysis;meta-analysis;quantitative analysis;Oceans and Seas;sea;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;pH;acidification;calcification;methodology;bone mineralization;Calcification;Physiologic;acid;Acids;alkalinity;coral reefs;aragonite saturation state;carbonate chemistry;CO2;coral calcification,,

The stable functioning of cnidarian symbioses is however dependent upon the host's ability to maintain demographic control of its algal partner. In this review, I explain how the modern envelope of seawater conditions found within many coral reef ecosystems (characterised by elevated temperatures, rising pCO2, and enriched nutrient levels) are antagonistic toward the dominant host processes that restrict excessive symbiont proliferation. Moreover, I outline a new hypothesis and initial evidence base, which support the suggestion that the additional ""excess"" zooxanthellae fraction permitted by seawater pCO2 levels beyond 260 ppmv significantly increases the propensity for symbiosis breakdown (""bleaching"") in response to temperature and irradiance extremes.

There is considerable complexity in coral-algae interactions; turf algae and macroalgae promote heterotrophic microbial overgrowth of coral, macroalgae also directly harm the corals via hydrophobic OM, whereas crustose coralline algae generally encourage benign microbial communities. In addition, complex flow patterns transport OM and pathogens from algae to downstream corals, and direct algal contact enhances their delivery.

The risks and severity of impact from dredging (and other sediment disturbances) on corals are primarily related to the intensity, duration and frequency of exposure to increased turbidity and sedimentation. The sensitivity of a coral reef to dredging impacts and its ability to recover depend on the antecedent ecological conditions of the reef, its resilience and the ambient conditions normally experienced. Effects of sediment stress have so far been investigated in 89 coral species (∼10\% of all known reef-building corals). Results of these investigations have provided a generic understanding of tolerance levels, response mechanisms, adaptations and threshold levels of corals to the effects of natural and anthropogenic sediment disturbances. Coral polyps undergo stress from high suspended-sediment concentrations and the subsequent effects on light attenuation which affect their algal symbionts. Minimum light requirements of corals range from \&lt;1\% to as much as 60\% of surface irradiance. Reported tolerance limits of coral reef systems for chronic suspended-sediment concentrations range from \&lt;10mgL-1 in pristine offshore reef areas to \&gt;100mgL-1 in marginal nearshore reefs. Some individual coral species can tolerate short-term exposure (days) to suspended-sediment concentrations as high as 1000mgL-1 while others show mortality after exposure (weeks) to concentrations as low as 30mgL-1. The duration that corals can survive high turbidities ranges from several days (sensitive species) to at least 5-6weeks (tolerant species). Increased sedimentation can cause smothering and burial of coral polyps, shading, tissue necrosis and population explosions of bacteria in coral mucus. Fine sediments tend to have greater effects on corals than coarse sediments. Turbidity and sedimentation also reduce the recruitment, survival and settlement of coral larvae. Maximum sedimentation rates that can be tolerated by different corals range from \&lt;10mgcm-2d-1 to \&gt;400mgcm-2d-1. The durations that corals can survive high sedimentation rates range from \&lt;24h for sensitive species to a few weeks (\&gt;4weeks of high sedimentation or \&gt;14days complete burial) for very tolerant species. Hypotheses to explain substantial differences in sensitivity between different coral species include the growth form of coral colonies and the size of the coral polyp or calyx. The validity of these hypotheses was tested on the basis of 77 published studies on the effects of turbidity and sedimentation on 89 coral species. The results of this analysis reveal a significant relationship of coral sensitivity to turbidity and sedimentation with growth form, but not with calyx size. Some of the variation in sensitivities reported in the literature may have been caused by differences in the type and particle size of sediments applied in experiments. The ability of many corals (in varying degrees) to actively reject sediment through polyp inflation, mucus production, ciliary and tentacular action (at considerable energetic cost), as well as intraspecific morphological variation and the mobility of free-living mushroom corals, further contribute to the observed differences. Given the wide range of sensitivity levels among coral species and in baseline water quality conditions among reefs, meaningful criteria to limit the extent and turbidity of dredging plumes and their effects on corals will always require site-specific evaluations, taking into account the species assemblage present at the site and the natural variability of local background turbidity and sedimentation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Environmental Monitoring;Water quality;coral reef;ecological impact;Coral reef;Coral Reefs;environmental impact;environmental stress;sea pollution;Animals;Reefs;article;coral;nonhuman;environmental exposure;risk assessment;Water Pollutants;Anthozoa;environmental monitoring;larval stage;photosynthesis;particle size;environmental management;turbidity;evolutionary adaptation;Geologic Sediments;Coral reef systems;dredging;survival;Sensitivity analysis;algae;Sedimentology;feeding behavior;Ecology;sedimentation;Suspended sediments;mitigation;disturbance;Environment;Tissue;Ships;survival rate;concentration (parameters);sedimentation rate;Turbidity;light intensity;Nearshores;Ambient conditions;Body fluids;Coarse sediment;Coral colonies;Corals;Critical threshold;Dredging;Dredging impacts;Ecological conditions;Energetic costs;environmental sanitation;Fine sediments;Fungiidae;Growth form;High turbidity;Light attenuation;Mitigation;Morphological variation;Natural variability;nutrient dynamics;Offshore reef;physical tolerance;Population explosion;Response mechanisms;Sedimentation;Sedimentation rates;Sensitive species;sexual behavior;Short-term exposure;Site-specific evaluation;Species assemblage;Surface irradiance;Suspended sediment concentrations;Threshold levels;Tissue necrosis;Tolerance levels;Tolerance limits;Tolerant species;Critical thresholds,,

(1) Local ecological monitoring since the 1960s shows that the coral reefs in the South China Sea have declined dramatically, reflecting the rapid decrease of living coral cover and the great loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae. Collectively, this has led to a significant decrease of annual CaCO3 production. Heavy anthropogenic activities and global warming are recognized as major triggers of the observed coral reef degradation. Observations show that the modern coral reefs in the SCS are a source of atmospheric CO2 in summer. (2) Coral reefs of the SCS have been widely used to reveal longer-term environmental variations, including Holocene high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) and abrupt climate events, millennial-scale El Niño variations, millennial- and centennial-scale sea level oscillations, strong and cyclic storm activities, East Asian monsoon intensities, variation in seawater pH, and recent seawater pollution. (3) Coral reefs of the southern SCS have experienced repeated episodes of bleaching over the last 200 years due to high SST and intense El Niño events; coral reefs of the northern SCS suffered high levels of mortality during several abrupt winter cold-water bleaching events during the middle Holocene warm period. On average, recovery after the middle Holocene cold-bleaching took 20-30 years; recovery following other middle Holocene environmental stresses took approximately 10-20 years. Such findings have significantly contributed to the understanding of the present ecological pressures faced by the coral reefs in the SCS, the histories of Holocene climate/environment changes, and the long-term models of coral reef responses to various past environmental changes. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Publisher: Science in China Press | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,check full text",,bleaching;coral reef;Coral reef;environmental stress;Marine pollution;Reefs;paleoenvironment;sea level change;Seawater;Anthozoa;Pacific Ocean;sea surface temperature;Surface waters;environmental degradation;global warming;mortality;calcium carbonate;environmental change;climate;Bleaching;Cleaning;Global warming;Sea level;South China Sea;biomonitoring;carbon dioxide;ecology;human activity;climate variation;Holocene;paleoclimate;Calcium carbonate;Ecology;Calcite;environment;Holocenes;storm;Climate models;monsoon;South China sea;coral reefs;China;Coral Reefs,,

This is estimated to be a large reduction since the 1960s. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was enacted in 1975 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) set up shortly afterwards. So the question is: why has coral cover continued to decline when the GBR is being managed with a management regime often recognised as 'the best managed coral reef system in the world', based on a strong science-for-management ethic. The stressors which are known to be most responsible for the loss of coral cover (and general 'reef health') are terrestrial pollution including the link to outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish, fishing impacts and climate change. These have been established through a long and intensive research effort over the last 30 years. However the management response of the GBRMPA after 1975, while based on a strong science-for-management program, did not concentrate on these issues but instead on managing access through zoning with restrictions on fishing in very limited areas and tourism management. Significant action on fishing, including trawling, did not occur until the Trawl Management Plan of 2000 and the rezoning of the GBR Marine Park in 2004. Effective action on terrestrial pollution did not occur until the Australian Government Reef Rescue initiative which commenced in 2008. Effective action on climate change has yet to begin either nationally or globally. Thus it is not surprising that coral cover on the GBR has reduced to values similar to those seen in other coral reef areas in the world such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Science has always required long periods to acquire sufficient evidence to drive management action and hence there is a considerable time lag between the establishment of scientific evidence and the introduction of effective management. It can still be credibly claimed that the GBR is the best managed coral reef system in the world but it must be realised that this is a relative assessment against other reef systems and management regimes and not an absolute claim for effective management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Australia;coral reef;Queensland;climate change;Anthozoa;environmental management;seagrass;research work;echinoderm;fishing;Philippines;pollution;marine park;Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;trawling;Acanthaster planci;Indonesia;Asteroidea;best management practice;critical analysis;tourism management;management evaluation,,

In the aquarium industry, many coral diseases and pathologies are known from the grey literature but as yet these have not been systematically described and the relationship to known diseases in the wild is difficult to determine. There is therefore scope to aid the maintenance and husbandry of corals in aquaria by informing the field of the scientifically described wild diseases, if these can be reliably related. Conversely, since the main driver to identifying coral diseases in aquaria is to select an effective treatment, the lessons learnt by aquarists on which treatments work with particular syndromes provides invaluable evidence for determining the causal agents. Such treatments are not commonly sought by scientists working in the natural environment due the cost and potential environmental impacts of the treatments. Here we review both wild and aquarium diseases and attempt to relate the two. Many important aquarium diseases could not be reconciled to those in the wild. In one case, however, namely that of the ciliate Helicostoma sp. as a causal agent of brown jelly syndrome in aquarium corals, there may be similarities with pathogenic agents of the wild coral diseases, such as white syndrome and brown band syndrome. We propose that Helicostoma is actually a misnomer, but improved understanding of this pathogen and others could benefit both fields. Improved practices in aquarium maintenance and husbandry would also benefit natural environments by reducing the scale of wild harvest and improving the potential for coral culture, both for the aquarium industry and for rehabilitation programmes.

Microbes on coral reefs play a critical role in regulating larval recruitment, bacterial colonization, and pathogen abundance under ambient conditions, ultimately governing the overall resilience of coral reef systems.

It is critical that coral reef managers understand these implications and have the ability to assess and reduce risk, detect and contain outbreaks, and monitor and minimise impacts. Here, we present a coral disease response framework that has four core components: (1) an early warning system, (2) a tiered impact assessment program, (3) scaled management actions and (4) a communication plan. The early warning system combines predictive tools that monitor the risk of outbreaks of temperature-dependent coral diseases with in situ observations provided by a network of observers who regularly report on coral health and reef state. Verified reports of an increase in disease prevalence trigger a tiered response of more detailed impact assessment, targeted research and/or management actions. The response is scaled to the risk posed by the outbreak, which is a function of the severity and spatial extent of the impacts. We review potential management actions to mitigate coral disease impacts and facilitate recovery, considering emerging strategies unique to coral disease and more established strategies to support reef resilience.

The underlying causes and mechanism(s) of coral bleaching are not well known, although several have been hypothesized. While coral bleaching has been a primary focus in recent years, corals respond differentially to numerous environmental stresses. The impacts of heat, hydrocarbons, salinity, sewage effluents, biocides, heavy metals, and ultraviolet light have been investigated in both laboratory experiments and field surveys among multiple coral species. Herein what is known regarding the biological impacts of such stresses on corals at the molecular level of organization is summarized. The objective is to focus attention at the early stages of biological effects in order to encourage and facilitate research that provide ways to understand how changes at the molecular level might elucidate processes likely occurring at the population level. This, in turn, should accelerate studies that may elucidate the cellular and physiological changes contributing to coral decline, rather than just document the continued global loss of coral diversity and abundance.

This review synthesizes previous work on the viruses associated with corals and their cnidarian relatives, and highlights some strengths and limitations of the methods commonly used for viral analysis. Based on these foundational studies, we present a current working model for stony coral virology. We hypothesize that viruses are present on and within corals and that these consortia commonly include representatives of the Herpesviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and phages and archaeal viruses. Our working model posits that these different viral groups target distinct hosts, specifically the coral itself, its endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.), and its resident microbiome, respectively. Corals may also harbor additional viral diversity (e.g., members of the Iridoviridae) that is pathogenic to reef-associated organisms. Viral infections likely underlie some coral diseases and may be responsible for reef epizootics, but evidence for viral-mediated coral disease is currently inconclusive. Future efforts in coral viral ecology should focus on determining if and how viral infection contributes to reduced coral fitness and/or benthic community shifts in reef ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;Anthozoa;host-symbiont interaction;Cnidaria;Scleractinia;benthos;endosymbiont;genomics;pathogenicity;numerical model;Symbiodinium;algae;abundance;Metagenomics;virus;Archaea;species diversity;infectivity;Herpesviridae;cell organelle;Iridoviridae;Iridovirus;Phycodnaviridae;viral disease;Disease;Virome;Virus,,

If similar trends are to be mitigated or avoided on reefs worldwide, a deeper understanding of the factors underlying the origin and spread of coral diseases and the steps that can be taken to prevent, control, or reduce their impacts is required. In recent years, an increased focus on coral microbiology and the application of classic culture techniques and emerging molecular technologies has revealed several coral pathogens that could serve as targets for novel coral disease diagnostic tools. The ability to detect and quantify microbial agents identified as indicators of coral disease will aid in the elucidation of disease causation and facilitate coral disease detection and diagnosis, pathogen monitoring in individuals and ecosystems, and identification of pathogen sources, vectors, and reservoirs.

Although the seawater carbonate system has been known for a long time, the understanding of acidification impacts on marine biota is in its infancy. Most publications about ocean acidification are less than a decade old and over half are about coral reefs. Contributions from physiological studies, particularly of coral calcification, have covered such a wide spectrum of variables that no cohesive picture of the mechanisms involved has yet emerged. To date, these studies show that coral calcification varies with carbonate ion availability which, in turn controls aragonite saturation. They also reveal synergies between acidification and the better understood role of elevated temperature. Ecological studies are unlikely to reveal much detail except for the observations of the effects of carbon dioxide springs in reefs. Although ocean acidification events are not well constrained in the geological record, recent studies show that they are clearly linked to extinction events including four of the five greatest crises in the history of coral reefs. However, as ocean acidification is now occurring faster than at any know time in the past, future predictions based on past events are in unchartered waters. Pooled evidence to date indicates that ocean acidification will be severely affecting reefs by mid century and will have reduced them to ecologically collapsed carbonate platforms by the century's end. This review concludes that most impacts will be synergistic and that the primary outcome will be a progressive reduction of species diversity correlated with habitat loss and widespread extinctions in most metazoan phyla. © 2011 by the authors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;marine ecosystem;climate change;Anthozoa;coral bleaching;carbonate platform;carbon dioxide;acidification;calcification;Animalia;Metazoa;physiological response;carbonate system;saturation;aragonite;carbon dioxide enrichment,,

The complexities of this degradation have been studied in detail, but little work has assessed characteristics that allow reefs to bounce back and recover between pulse disturbance events. We quantitatively review recovery rates of coral cover from pulse disturbance events among 48 different reef locations, testing the relative roles of disturbance characteristics, reef characteristics, connectivity and anthropogenic influences. Reefs in the western Pacific Ocean had the fastest recovery, whereas reefs in the geographically isolated eastern Pacific Ocean were slowest to recover, reflecting regional differences in coral composition, fish functional diversity and geographic isolation. Disturbances that opened up large areas of benthic space recovered quickly, potentially because of nonlinear recovery where recruitment rates were high. The type of disturbance had a limited effect on subsequent rates of reef recovery, although recovery was faster following crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. This inconsequential role of disturbance type may be in part due to the role of unaltered structural complexity in maintaining key reef processes, such as recruitment and herbivory. Few studies explicitly recorded potential ecological determinants of recovery, such as recruitment rates, structural complexity of habitat and the functional composition of reef-associated fish. There was some evidence of slower recovery rates within protected areas compared with other management systems and fished areas, which may reflect the higher initial coral cover in protected areas rather than reflecting a management effect. A better understanding of the driving role of processes, structural complexity and diversity on recovery may enable more appropriate management actions that support coral-dominated ecosystems in our changing climate. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;Anthozoa;Pacific Ocean;anthropogenic effect;coral bleaching;habitat conservation;Coral bleaching;Resilience;ecosystem function;echinoderm;ecosystem resilience;connectivity;marine park;Diversity;species diversity;Acanthaster planci;Asteroidea;Pacific Ocean (East);Marine protected areas;Coral reef ecology;Ecosystem function;Coral Reefs,,

Scleractinian corals function as the primary reef ecosystem engineers, constructing the framework that serves as a habitat for all other coral reef-associated organisms. However, the coral's engineering role is particularly susceptible to global climate change. Ocean warming can cause extensive mass coral bleaching, which triggers dysfunction of major engineering processes. Sub-lethal bleaching results in the reduction of both primary productivity and coral calcification. This may lead to changes in the release of organic and inorganic products, thereby altering critical biogeochemical and recycling processes in reef ecosystems. Thermal stress-induced bleaching and subsequent coral mortality, along with ocean acidification, further lead to long-term shifts in benthic community structure, changes in topographic reef complexity, and the modification of reef functioning. Such shifts may cause negative feedback loops and further modification of coral-derived inorganic and organic products. This review emphasises the critical role of scleractinian corals as reef ecosystem engineers and highlights the control of corals over key reef ecosystem goods and services, including high biodiversity, coastal protection, fishing, and tourism.

Recruitment indirectly affects both renewal and maintenance of existing and future coral communities, coral reef biodiversity (bottom-up effect) and therefore coral reef resilience. This process has been used as an indirect measure of individual reproductive success (fitness) and is the final stage of larval dispersal leading to population connectivity. As a result, recruitment has been proposed as an indicator of coral-reef health in marine protected areas, as well as a central aspect of the decision-making process concerning management and conservation. The creation of management plans to promote impact mitigation, rehabilitation and conservation of the Colombian coral reefs is a necessity that requires firstly, a review and integration of existing literature on scleractinian coral recruitment in Colombia and secondly, larger scale field studies.

In the last three decades a global decline on coral reef barriers has been observed and this has been attributed to, among other causes, two processes that directly interferes in the coral-zooxanthellae interaction: 'coral bleaching' and epidemics. Bleaching events are characterized by a sudden loss of zooxanthellae, commonly leading to mass mortality on coral colonies. Although it is not possible to establish causal relations, the intensities of epidemics and bleaching events are correlated, indicating that the symbiosis is a protective factor on coral's health.

WIO reefs were categorized into three major SST groups of differing coral cover change. Cover change was negatively associated with standard deviation (SD) SST until about SD 2.3, with increasing flatness of the SST frequency distributions.

Over the past 30 years, coral diseases have been widely recognized for their destructive impacts on coral reefs. To date, more than 30 types of coral diseases have been identified, but only 6 types have been determined of their specific pathogens. Here we briefly introduce the symptoms and the rates of spreading, incidencing and mortality of Severn main types of scleractinian coral diseases (black-band disease, dark spots disease, white-band disease, white plague, white pox disease, yellow band disease, and bacterial bleaching), and review their influences on coral reef ecology and the relationship between coral diseases and environmental factors. Based on present understanding, the frequent occurrence of coral diseases can reduce coral cover, and which in turn can result in the shift of a coral reef from a coral-dominant community into a fleshy seaweed-dominant one. The factors that cause coral diseases include seawater temperature, pH, nutrition concentration, chemicals, dissolved oxygen concentration, and their combined influences, and the warming of global climate and the increasing of human activities are believed to have triggered the changes of the above environmental factors and the outbreak of coral diseases. It is clearly identified that the elevated seawater temperature is the essential factor in outbreak of bacterial bleaching of coral Oculina patagonica and Pocillopora damicornis. Other factors, such as enriched nutrition, exceeded organic pollutants and the changing of seawater pH values can bring physiological stress to corals, and then reduce the coral's resistance to diseases. Coral cover, water depth and seawater disolved oxygen concentration are also observed to have influences on coral diseases, with corals at shallow water and high coral cover habitat being easily infected.","Publisher: Science Press | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,bleaching;coral reef;environmental factor;coral;seawater;Anthozoa;Scleractinia;mortality;water depth;dissolved oxygen;shallow water;water temperature;Bacteria (microorganisms);Oculina patagonica;Pocillopora damicornis;human activity;Animalia;disease incidence;disease spread;pathogen;infectivity;organic pollutant,,

In this paper, I review recent research into the climate-induced breakdown of this important symbiosis (namely 'coral bleaching') that challenges the validity of this long-standing belief. Indeed, I introduce a more parsimonious explanation, in which the coral host exerts a 'controlled parasitism' over its algal symbionts that is akin to an enforced domestication arrangement. Far from being pathogenic, a range of well-established cellular processes are reviewed that support the role of the coral host as an active 'farmer' of the energy-rich photoassimilates from its captive symbionts. Importantly, this new paradigm reposes the deleterious bleaching response in terms of an envelope of environmental conditions in which the exploitative and captive measures of the coral host are severely restricted. The ramification of this new paradigm for developing management strategies that may assist the evolution of bleaching resistance in corals is discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,bleaching;coral;nonhuman;review;Anthozoa;photosynthesis;symbiosis;symbiont;coral bleaching;pathogenesis;climate;alga;Symbiodinium;algae;evolution;mutualism;parasitism;endosymbiosis;domestication;waste management;zooxanthellae,,

This has led to renewed interest in the 'deep reef refugia' hypothesis (DRRH), which stipulates that deep reef areas (1) are protected or dampened from disturbances that affect shallow reef areas and (2) can provide a viable reproductive source for shallow reef areas following disturbance. Using the Caribbean as an example, the assumptions of this hypothesis were explored by reviewing the literature for scleractinian corals-the reef framework builders on tropical reefs. Although there is evidence to support that deep reefs ({\textgreater}30 m) can escape the direct effects of storm-induced waves and thermal bleaching events, deep reefs are certainly not immune to disturbance. Additionally, the potential of deep reefs to provide propagules for shallow reef areas seems limited to 'depth-generalist' coral species, which constitute only 25\% of the total coral biodiversity. Larval connectivity between shallow and deep populations of these species may be further limited due to specific life history traits (e.g., brooding reproductive strategy and vertical symbiont acquisition mode). This review exposes how little is known about deep reefs and coral reproduction over depth. Hence, a series of urgent research priorities are proposed to determine the extent to which deep reefs may act as a refuge in the face of global reef decline. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Publisher: Springer Verlag | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;coral;Anthozoa;Scleractinia;shallow water;environmental disturbance;refugium;life history trait;hypothesis testing;reproductive strategy;Deep coral reef;Disturbance;Global climate change;Mesophotic;Refugia;Caribbean Region,,

Currently, mitigation efforts are proving ineffectual in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Coral reefs are the most sensitive ecosystems on the planet to climate change, and here we review modelling a number of geoengineering options, and their potential influence on coral reefs. There are two categories of geoengineering, shortwave solar radiation management and longwave carbon dioxide removal. The first set of techniques only reduce some, but not all, effects of climate change, while possibly creating other problems. They also do not affect CO2 levels and therefore fail to address the wider effects of rising CO2, including ocean acidification, important for coral reefs. Solar radiation is important to coral growth and survival, and solar radiation management is not in general appropriate for this ecosystem. Longwave carbon dioxide removal techniques address the root cause of climate change, rising CO2 concentrations, they have relatively low uncertainties and risks. They are worthy of further research and potential implementation, particularly carbon capture and storage, biochar, and afforestation methods, alongside increased mitigation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Emerging coral diseases are one serious threat implicated in extensive reef deterioration through disruption of the integrity of the coral holobiont - a complex symbiosis between the coral animal, endobiotic alga and an array of microorganisms. In this article, we review our current understanding of the role of microorganisms in coral health and disease, and highlight the pressing interdisciplinary research priorities required to elucidate the mechanisms of disease. We advocate an approach that applies knowledge gained from experiences in human and veterinary medicine, integrated into multidisciplinary studies that investigate the interactions between host, agent and environment of a given coral disease. These approaches include robust and precise disease diagnosis, standardised ecological methods and application of rapidly developing DNA, RNA and protein technologies, alongside established histological, microbial ecology and ecological expertise. Such approaches will allow a better understanding of the causes of coral mortality and coral reef declines and help assess potential management options to mitigate their effects in the longer term.

This article reviews the suitability of a range of bioindicators for use in monitoring programmes that link changes in water quality to changes in the condition of coral-reef ecosystems. From the literature, 21 candidate bioindicators were identified, whose responses to changes in water quality varied spatially and temporally; responses ranged from rapid (hours) changes within individual corals to long-term (years) changes in community composition. From this list, the most suitable bioindicators were identified by determining whether responses were (i) specific, (ii) monotonic, (iii) variable, (iv) practical and (v) ecologically relevant to management goals. For long-term monitoring programmes that aim to quantify the effects of chronic changes in water quality, 11 bioindicators were selected: symbiont photophysiology, colony brightness, tissue thickness and surface rugosity of massive corals, skeletal elemental and isotopic composition, abundance of macro-bioeroders, micro- and meiobenthic organisms such as foraminifera, coral recruitment, macroalgal cover, taxonomic richness of corals and the maximal depth of coral-reef development. For short-term monitoring programmes, or environmental impact assessments that aim to quantify the effects of acute changes in water quality, a subset of seven of these bioindicators were selected, including partial mortality. Their choice will depend on the specific objectives and the timeframe available for each monitoring programme.

While sparisomid parrotfishes are major grazers of Caribbean reefs and help control algal blooms, the fact that they also undertake corallivory has prompted some to question the rationale for their conservation. Here the weight of evidence for beneficial effects of parrotfishes, in terms of reducing algal cover and facilitating demographic processes in corals, and the deleterious effects of parrotfishes in terms of causing coral mortality and chronic stress, are reviewed. While elevated parrotfish density will likely increase the predation rate upon juvenile corals, the net effect appears to be positive in enhancing coral recruitment through removal of macroalgal competitors. Parrotfish corallivory can cause modest partial colony mortality in the most intensively grazed species of Montastraea but the generation and healing of bite scars appear to be in near equilibrium, even when coral cover is low. Whole colony mortality in adult corals can lead to complete exclusion of some delicate, lagoonal species of Porites from forereef environments but is only reported for one reef species (Porites astreoides), for one habitat (backreef), and with uncertain incidence (though likely {\textless}{\textless}10\%). No deleterious effects of predation on coral growth or fecundity have been reported, though recovery of zooxanthellae after bleaching events may be retarded. The balance of evidence to date finds strong support for the herbivory role of parrotfishes in facilitating coral recruitment, growth, and fecundity. In contrast, no net deleterious effects of corallivory have been reported for reef corals. Corallivory is unlikely to constrain overall coral cover but contraints upon dwindling populations of the Montastraea annularis species complex are feasible and the role of parrotfishes as a vector of coral disease requires evaluation. However, any assertion that conservation practices should guard against protecting corallivorous parrotfishes appears to be unwarranted at this stage. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;marine ecosystem;fish;Anthozoa;Coral;growth rate;Porites;Conservation;mortality;species conservation;grazing;herbivory;algae;population density;juvenile;Scaridae;Mortality;predation risk;algal community;Porites astreoides;annularis species complex;Montastraea annularis;fecundity;Montastraea;Herbivore;Caribbean Region;Herbivory,,

These data were combined with habitat maps and expert judgment on the vulnerability of different habitat types in the Monument to estimate spatial patterns of current cumulative impact at 1 ha (0.01 km2) resolution. Cumulative impact was greatest for shallow reef areas and peaked at Maro Reef, where 13 of the 14 threats overlapped in places. Ocean temperature variation associated with disease outbreaks was found to have the highest predicted impact overall, followed closely by other climate-related threats, none of which have easily tractable management solutions at the regional scale. High impact threats most tractable to regional management relate to ship traffic. Sensitivity analyses show that the results are robust to both data availability and quality. Managers can use these maps to (1) inform management and surveillance priorities based on the ranking of threats and their distributions, (2) guide permitting decisions based on cumulative impacts, and (3) choose areas to monitor for climate change effects.

Almost all coral species bleached, including Acropora palmata, which bleached for the first time on record in the USVI. As water temperatures cooled, corals began to regain their normal coloration. However, a severe disease outbreak then occurred on deeper, non-acroporid reefs. The disease demonstrated signs consistent with white plague. Monitoring of coral cover along previously established long-term transects on several reefs in St. John and St. Croix was intensified. Data on bleaching and disease were collected before, during and after this bleaching/disease episode. Average coral cover declined by over 50\%, from 21.4\% to 10.3\% at the long-term study sites, within one year of the onset of bleaching, declining further to 8.3\% after two years. This loss of coral cover was greater than from all other stressors affecting the USVI reefs in preceding years, and no significant recovery is evident. Disease prevalence increased on bleached A. palmata colonies that were being monitored as well as on the colonies of other species on the deeper reefs. Bleached A. palmata colonies had more disease (primarily white pox and other un-described diseases) than unbleached colonies. The non-acroporid corals that bleached most severely suffered the highest mortality from disease.

The hypothesis that solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290-400 nm) is an important factor that affects the biology and ecology of coral reef organisms dates only to about 1980. It has been previously suggested that increased levels of biologically effective ultraviolet B radiation (UVB, 290-320 nm), which is the waveband primarily affected by ozone depletion, would have relatively small effects on corals and coral reefs and that these effects might be observed as changes in the minimum depths of occurrence of important reef taxa such as corals. This conclusion was based on predictions of increases in UVR as well as its attenuation with depth using the available data on UVR irradiances, ozone levels, and optical properties of the water overlying coral reefs. Here, we review the experimental evidence demonstrating the direct and indirect effects of UVR, both UVB and ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm) on corals and other reef associated biota, with emphasis on those studies conducted since 1996. Additionally, we re-examine the predictions made in 1996 for the increase in UVB on reefs with currently available data, assess whether those predictions were reasonable, and look at what changes might occur on coral reefs in the future as the multiple effects (i.e. increased temperature, hypercapnia, and ocean acidification) of global climate change continue. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.","Publisher: Royal Society of Chemistry | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,bleaching;coral reef;climate change;Animals;coral;nonhuman;review;marine species;Anthozoa;oxidative stress;ultraviolet radiation;Ultraviolet Rays;larval development;taxonomy;priority journal;evolutionary adaptation;global climate;biota;acidification;hypercapnia;reproduction;photooxidation;solar radiation;prediction;Marine Biology;DNA damage;biology;temperature acclimatization;optics;ozone depletion;Photobiology;ultraviolet A radiation;ultraviolet B radiation,,

Anthropogenic modification of chemical and physical atmospheric dynamics that cause coral death by bleaching and newly emergent diseases due to increased heat and irradiation, as well as decline in calcification caused by ocean acidification due to increased CO2, are the most important large-scale threats. On more local scales, overfishing and destructive fisheries, coastal construction, nutrient enrichment, increased runoff and sedimentation, and the introduction of nonindigenous invasive species have caused phase shifts away from corals. Already ∼20\% of the world's reefs are lost and ∼26\% are under imminent threat. Conservation science of coral reefs is well advanced, but its practical application has often been lagging. Societal priorites, economic pressures, and legaladministrative systems of many countries are more prone to destroy rather than conserve coral-reef ecosystems. Nevertheless, many examples of successful conservation exist from the national level to community-enforced local action. When effectively managed, protected areas have contributed to regeneration of coral reefs and stocks of associated marine resources. Local communities often support coral-reef conservation in order to raise income potential associated with tourism andor improved resource levels. Coral reefs create an annual income in S-Florida alone of over \$4 billion. Thus, no conflict between development, societal welfare, and coral-reef conservation needs to exist. Despite growing threats, it is not too late for decisive action to protect and save these economically and ecologically high-value ecosystems.

Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Their valuable goods and services are fundamental to the livelihood of large coastal populations in the tropics. The health of many of the world's coral reefs, and the goods and services they provide, have already been severely compromised, largely due to over-exploitation by a range of human activities. These local-scale impacts, with the appropriate government instruments, support and management actions, can potentially be controlled and even ameliorated. Unfortunately, other human actions (largely in countries outside of the tropics), by changing global climate, have added additional global-scale threats to the continued survival of present-day coral reefs. Moderate warming of the tropical oceans has already resulted in an increase in mass coral bleaching events, affecting nearly all of the world's coral reef regions. The frequency of these events will only increase as global temperatures continue to rise. Weakening of coral reef structures will be a more insidious effect of changing ocean chemistry, as the oceans absorb part of the excess atmospheric carbon dioxide. More intense tropical cyclones, changed atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns will all affect coral reef ecosystems and the many associated plants and animals. Coral reefs will not disappear but their appearance, structure and community make-up will radically change.

Conversely, in conditions of environmental stress, certain microorganisms cause coral bleaching and other diseases. Recent research indicates that corals can develop resistance to specific pathogens and adapt to higher environmental temperatures. To explain these findings the coral probiotic hypothesis proposes the occurrence of a dynamic relationship between symbiotic microorganisms and corals that selects for the coral holobiont that is best suited for the prevailing environmental conditions.

Hosts are not only responsible for balancing their internal osmolarity with respect to the external environment, but they must also maintain a compatible osmotic environment for their endosymbionts, which may themselves contribute to the net osmolarity of the host cell through molecular fluxes and/or exchange. Cnidarian hosts that harbor intracellular dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) are excellent examples of such a symbiosis. These associations are characterized by the exchange of osmotically active compounds, but they are temporally stable under normal environmental conditions indicating that these osmotically driven exchanges are effectively and rapidly regulated. Although we have some knowledge about how asymbiotic anthozoans and algae osmoregulate, our understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in regulating an intact anthozoan-dinoflagellate symbiosis is poor. Large-scale expulsion of endosymbiotic zooxanthellae, or bleaching, is currently considered to be one of the greatest threats to coral reefs worldwide. To date, there has been little consideration of the osmotic scenarios that occur when these symbioses are exposed to the conditions that normally elicit bleaching, such as increased seawater temperatures and UV radiation.

In reviewing the ecotoxicological studies conducted so far, PSII herbicides appear able to readily penetrate the coral tissues and rapidly (within minutes) reduce the photochemical efficiency of the intracellular algal symbionts. The dinoflagellates appear at least as sensitive to PSII herbicides as other phototrophs tested so far, with photosynthesis being affected at exceptionally low concentrations (i.e. in the ng l-1 range). At these levels and over short exposure periods, the effects can be fully reversible (i.e. when corals are returned to clean seawater) and vary according to type of herbicide; however, when exposed to higher concentrations in the light or over longer exposure periods, it results in a long-term sustained reduction of the photochemical efficiency of the algae (symptomatic of chronic photoinhibition). This can result in the dissociation of the symbiosis (bleaching) which is a common but nevertheless significant sub lethal stress response requiring many months to recover from. It is argued that the reliance of corals on an endosymbiotic photoautotrophic energy source, together with predilection for the symbiosis to dissociate when photosynthesis of the algae is affected, renders coral particularly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions-and especially phytotoxins such as PSII herbicides. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This bleaching has frequently been attributed to photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.). However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching in coral zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of ROS by the thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular ROS are involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,bleaching;Anthozoa;photosynthesis;coral bleaching;Symbiodinium;hydrogen peroxide;zooxanthella;reactive oxygen species;temperature effect;photoinhibition;singlet oxygen;corals;zooxanthellae,,

While significant gaps still exist in our understanding of how ""normal"" reefs work, unprecedented changes in coral reef systems have forced the research community to change its focus from basic research to understand how one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world works to basic research with strong applied implications to alleviate damage, save, or restore coral reef ecosystems. A wide range of stressors on local, regional, and global spatial scales including over fishing, diseases, large-scale disturbance events, global climate change (e.g., ozone depletion, global warming), and over population have all contributed to declines in coral cover or phase shifts in community structure on time scales never observed before. Many of these changes are directly or indirectly related to anthropogenically induced changes in the global support network that affects all ecosystems. This review focuses on some recent advances in the experimental biology of coral reef ecosystems, and in particular scleractinian corals, at all levels of biological organization.

A phase shift occurs on a coral reef when the cover of a substrate by scleractinian corals is reduced in favor of macroalgal dominance, and resilience of the former condition is retarded because of ecological processes and/or environmental conditions. The change is often, but not always, associated with a perturbation such as coral bleaching, outbreaks of a coral-eating species, or storm damage. The new state is generally associated with some combination of reduced herbivory (from disease and/or fishing) and nutrient enrichment, although the relative importance of these factors is under debate and may vary among locations and even across single reefs. Disturbances that result in a state of generally low biotic three-dimensional structural complexity often precede a phase shift. Following such a disturbance, the system will pass to a state of higher biotic structural complexity, with either macroalgae or coral dominating. As the community progresses towards larger and more three-dimensionally complex corals or macroalgae, it exhibits greater resistance to shifting dominance from one state to the other. Studies of the phase-shift phenomena have been generally conducted at scales that are small relative to the sizes and inherent variability of whole coral reefs and systems of reefs. There is an urgent need for studies aimed at quantifying and simulating cause and effect aspects of the phase shift, including human-environment coupling, particularly in support of coral reef decision-making. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Oceanography;coral reef;marine ecosystem;Anthozoa;Decision making;Scleractinia;environmental change;Bleaching;alga;ecosystem function;algae;Structural complexity;Ecology;Environmental impact;Algae;Mathematical models;Coral reefs;Coral-eating species;Macroalgae,,

Experiments and observations indicate that coral bleaching results primarily from elevated seawater temperatures under high light conditions, which increases rates of biochemical reactions associated with zooxanthellar photosynthesis, producing toxic forms of oxygen that interfere with cellular processes. Published projections of a baseline of increasing ocean temperature resulting from global warming have suggested that annual temperature maxima within 30 years may be at levels that will cause frequent coral bleaching and widespread mortality leading to decline of corals as dominant organisms on reefs. However, these projections have not considered the high variability in bleaching response that occurs among corals both within and among species. There is information that corals and their symbionts may be capable of acclimatization and selective adaptation to elevated temperatures that have already resulted in bleaching resistant coral populations, both locally and regionally, in various areas of the world. There are possible mechanisms that might provide resistance and protection to increased temperature and light. These include inducible heat shock proteins that act in refolding denatured cellular and structural proteins, production of oxidative enzymes that inactivate harmful oxygen radicals, fluorescent coral pigments that both reflect and dissipate light energy, and phenotypic adaptations of zooxanthellae and adaptive shifts in their populations at higher temperatures. Such mechanisms, when considered in conjunction with experimental and observational evidence for coral recovery in areas that have undergone coral bleaching, suggest an as yet undefined capacity in corals and zooxanthellae to adapt to conditions that have induced coral bleaching. Clearly, there are limits to acclimatory processes that can counter coral bleaching resulting from elevated sea temperatures, but scientific models will not accurately predict the fate of reef corals until we have a better understanding of coral-algal acclimatization/adaptation potential. Research is particularly needed with respect to the molecular and physiological mechanisms that promote thermal tolerance in corals and zooxanthellae and identification of genetic characteristics responsible for the variety of responses that occur in a coral bleaching event. Only then will we have some idea of the nature of likely responses, the timescales involved and the role of 'experience' in modifying bleaching impact.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Environmental Monitoring;coral reef;animal;Animals;review;Anthozoa;physiology;environmental monitoring;symbiosis;acclimatization;Acclimatization;adaptation;coral bleaching;global warming;mortality;Symbiosis;water temperature;population dynamics;Population Dynamics;alga;Dinoflagellida;ecology;algae;acclimation;methodology;Ecology;Algae;pigmentation;Mortality;Pigmentation;Dinoflagellate,,

They could also be useful for coarser, from a spatial and thematic point of view, global mapping and updating purposes.

Bleaching generally results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Optical remote sensing, from satellites or aircraft, is possibly the only means of measuring the effects of such stresses at appropriately large spatial scales (many thousands of square kilometres). To map key variables such as coral community structure, percentages of living coral or percentages of dead coral, a remote sensing instrument must be able to distinguish the reflectance spectra (i.e. ""spectral signature"", reflected light as a function of wavelength) of each category. For biotic classes, reflectance is a complex function of pigmentation, structure and morphology. Studies of coral ""colour"" fall into two disparate but potentially complementary types. Firstly, biological studies tend to investigate the structure and significance of pigmentation in reef organisms. These studies often lack details that would be useful from a remote sensing perspective such as intraspecific variation in pigment concentration or the contribution of fluorescence to reflectance. Secondly, remote sensing studies take empirical measurements of spectra and seek wavelengths that discriminate benthic categories. Benthic categories used in remote sensing sometimes consist of species groupings that are biologically or spectrally inappropriate (e.g. merging of algal phyla with distinct pigments). Here, we attempt to bridge the gap between biological and remote sensing perspectives of pigmentation in reef taxa. The aim is to assess the extent to which spectral discrimination can be given a biological foundation, to reduce the ad hoc nature of discriminatory criteria, and to understand the fundamental (biological) limitations in the spectral separability of biotic classes. Sources of pigmentation in reef biota are reviewed together with remote sensing studies where spectral discrimination has been effectively demonstrated between benthic categories. The basis of reflectance is considered as the sum of pigmented components, such as zooxanthellae, host tissues and skeletons of corals. Problems in the empirical in situ measurement of reflectance are identified, such as the differing types of reflectance which can be measured, the interaction of the light field with morphology, and depth-dependent variability of measured reflectance due to fluorescence. The latter is estimated in some cases to introduce an error of up to 20\% when depth differs by 8 m. Spectral features useful in discriminating reef benthos are identified and related to pigmentation. The slope in the reflectance spectra between 650 and 690 nm is dependent on chlorophyll-a concentration and can be used to discriminate bare sand with no algal component from chlorophyll-a containing benthos (algae, corals). The slope in reflectance at various locations between 500 and 560 nm can be useful in discriminating bleached and unbleached corals, possibly due to reduced peridinin concentration. Rhodophyta may be discernible by the presence of a dip in reflectance at 570 nm, due to a phycoerythrin absorption peak. However, the utility of some discriminatory criteria in deeper waters is mitigated by the relatively poor transmission of light through water at longer wavelengths (especially {\textgreater}600 nm). Contrary to suggested categorizations of fluorescent pigments in coral host tissues, it is shown that these pigments form an almost continuous distribution with respect to their excitation and emission peaks. Remote sensing by induced fluorescence is a promising approach, but further details about the variation and distribution of these pigments are required. It is hoped that this review will promote cross-disciplinary collaboration between pigment biologists and the reef remote sensing community. Where possible, the discriminative criteria adopted in remote sensing should be related to biological phenomena, thus lending an intuitive, process-orientated basis for interpreting spectral data. Similarly, remote sensing may provide a novel scaling perspective to biological studies of pigmentation in reef organisms.","Publisher: Academic Press | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Color;Oceanography;Environmental Monitoring;coral reef;climate change;ecosystem;Ecosystem;animal;Animals;review;Anthozoa;remote sensing;anthropogenic effect;physiology;environmental monitoring;chlorophyll;Oceans and Seas;procedures;sea;Chlorophyll;alga;image processing;algae;pigment;devices;Fluorescence;Biological;light;Eukaryota;eukaryote;methodology;color;oceanography;instrumentation;fluorescence;Algae;pigmentation;Light;Computer-Assisted;Image Processing;Rhodophyta;Pigmentation;cellular organisms;Pigments;reflectance,,

The thermal physiology of zooxanthellate reef corals is reviewed in this paper in the context of organismal and biochemical responses occurring during coral bleaching, with emphasis on methods of detection and interpretation of animal and algal symbiont stress. Coral bleaching, as presently defined in the literature, is a highly subjective term used to describe a variety of conditions pertaining to low symbiont densities in the coral-algal complex, including response to thermal stress. Three general types of high-temperature bleaching are defined: physiological bleaching, which may or may not include higher-than-normal temperature responses; algal-stress bleaching, involving dysfunction of symbiotic algae at high light and/or high temperatures; and animal-stress bleaching, where coral cells containing symbiotic algae are shed from the gastrodermal layer of cells. Since none of these methods of bleaching is mutually exclusive, a combination of intrusive and non-intrusive techniques is necessary to determine which mechanisms of symbiont loss are occurring. While quantification of symbiont densities, algal pigments, and coral tissue biomass provide unambiguous evidence of bleaching severity, measurements of physiological and biochemical degradation offer additional correlative evidence of temperature stress. Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry has emerged as an easy and relatively inexpensive non-invasive technique for monitoring symbiotic algal function both in situ and in the laboratory, when proper assumptions and interpretations are made.

The relationship, if any, between human activities and the incidence of coral disease is particularly important since it is frequently assumed that the number and prevalence of diseases are increasing, and are indicative of a general decline in the marine environment. Certainly a good understanding of these issues would assist in the conservation of coral reefs by identifying targets for mitigating management programmes. In situ observations of coral disease and associated mortality were therefore compiled from more than 150 sources, and reviewed. Although there have been cases where disease has caused major changes in the composition and structure of reefs, most notably in the Caribbean, these are exceptions when compared to the number of locations at which disease has been observed. With the exception of white-band disease, most frequently observed diseases do not appear to be specific in their host requirements, affecting species in many different genera. The overwhelming majority of disease in the Caribbean (97\% of locations) has been recorded from coral reefs where human activities are expected to have medium to high impacts. Regional scale patterns in the incidence of coral disease may therefore be suitable bio-indicators of disturbance to coral reefs. This potential relationship should be investigated further with a view to using patterns of disease to monitor specific sources of stress on reefs.

Human activities alter the natural disturbance regimes of coral reefs by transforming pulse events into persistent disturbance or even chronic stress, by introducing new disturbance, or by suppressing or removing disturbance. Adding these alterations to natural disturbance regimes will probably result in unknown synergistic effects. Simultaneously, humans are altering the capacity of reefs to cope with disturbance (e.g. by habitat fragmentation and reduction of functional diversity), which further exacerbates the effects of altered disturbance regimes. A disturbance that previously triggered the renewal and development of reefs might, under such circumstances, become an obstacle to development.

A principal cause of reef damage in Florida is ships running into reefs. The other major human impact on Florida's reels is dredging for beach renourishment and channel maintenance. In response to chronic reef damage, federal and state agencies and consultants have developed techniques to restore, as best possible, reefs impacted by human disturbance. These efforts include salvaging sponges and corals, removing loose debris from the reel, rebuilding three-dimensional (3-D) structures onto leveled-scarified reef surfaces, and transplanting sponges and corals back on the cleared reef surfaces. This paper presents an overview of restoration approaches; a discussion on legal and administration to both damage and restoration of these essential fish habitats; a brief review of some case studies; and a discussion of restoration success criteria. Salvage of corals and sponges is critical to the success of any reef restoration effort. If a living surface is allowed to sit on the sand for a few days, that surface will die. Often the grounded vessel will have crushed the reef, excavating sediments and rubble that end up as a berm of material behind the ship's resting position. Dealing with massive amounts of rubble debris is challenging. The options include leaving it in place and stabilizing it with cements; moving it a long way from the site and dumping it in deep water; or reconfiguring it by moving it off reef and building piles where it can do no harm. After the debris is moved off the reef platform, corals and other sessile benthic organisms (salvaged resources) can be transplanted on the damaged area. Monitoring is important to determine the success of the restoration and to look for ways to improve future projects. Sampling sites for monitoring should include restored areas plus a reference area (undamaged habitat of a relatively similar nature that is in close proximity) for comparison. The following questions should be addressed for any reef restoration project: are the transplanted organisms still secured to the reef? Is the vitality (color, disease, algal competition) of the transplanted organisms equivalent to the organisms in the reference sites? Is recruitment (settlement of juvenile organisms) similar in the restored areas and the reference areas? Monitoring should be tied to decision making so corrections can be made.

The earlier consensus was that widespread but localized damage from natural factors such as storms, and direct anthropogenic effects such as increased sedimentation, pollution and exploitation, posed the largest immediate threat to coral reefs. Now truly global factors associated with accelerating Global Climate Change are either damaging coral reefs or have the potential to inflict greater damage in the immediate future: e.g. increases in coral bleaching and mortality, and reductions in coral calcification due to changes in sea-water chemistry with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Rises in sea level will probably disrupt human communities and their cultures by making coral cays uninhabitable, whereas coral reefs will sustain minimal damage from the rise in sea level. The short-term (decades) prognosis is indeed grim, with major reductions almost certain in the extent and biodiversity of coral reefs, and severe disruptions to cultures and economies dependent on reef resources. The long-term (centuries to millennia) prognosis is more encouraging because coral reefs have remarkable resilience to severe disruption and will probably show this resilience in the future when climate changes either stabilize or reverse.","Publisher: CSIRO | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,coral reef;climate change;Anthozoa;anthropogenic effect;ecosystem function;global change,,

In most cases bleaching has been attributed to elevated temperature, but other instances involving high solar irradiance, and sometimes disease, have also been documented. It is timely, in view of our concern about worldwide reef condition, to review knowledge of physical and biological factors involved in bleaching, the mechanisms of zooxanthellae and pigment loss, and the ecological consequences for coral communities. Here we evaluate recently acquired data on temperature and irradiance-induced bleaching, including long-term data sets which suggest that repeated bleaching events may be the consequence of a steadily rising background sea temperature that will in the future expose corals to an increasingly hostile environment. Cellular mechanisms of bleaching involve a variety of processes that include the degeneration of zooxanthellae in situ, release of zooxanthellae from mesenterial filaments and release of algae within host cells which become detached from the endoderm. Photo-protective defences (particularly carotenoid pigments) in zooxanthellae are likely to play an important role in limiting the bleaching response which is probably elicited by a combination of elevated temperature and irradiance in the field. The ability of corals to respond adaptively to recurrent bleaching episodes is not known, but preliminary evidence suggests that phenotypic responses of both corals and zooxanthellae may be significant. © Springer-Verlag 1997.","Publisher: Springer Verlag | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Anthozoa,,

We have only begun to document gross, qualitative effects of UVR on coral reef organisms, usually in experiments comparing the biological response to the presence or absence of UVR through the use of UV-cutoff filters, or to varying levels of UVR in transplantation studies. Most such studies have not distinguished between the effects of UVA (320-400 nm) and those of UVB (290-320 nm), although in the context of global change involving stratospheric ozone loss, it is the latter wavelengths that are relevant. To date we have been addressing physiological and ecological questions, not yet attempting to evaluate quantitatively the impact of forecast increases in solar UVB penetration. Interacting and synergistic effects of UVR with increased temperature, pollutants, sedimentation, visible light, etc. have scarcely been studied but will be essential to understanding and predicting the fate of coral reefs under conditions of global change. Here we comprehensively review the effects of UVR on corals and other reef macroorganisms, mindful that although much is known of proximal effects, little of this knowledge is directly useful in making long-term predictions regarding the health of coral reefs. We conclude that even small anthropogenic increases in UVB levels will have sublethal physiological manifestations in corals and other reef organisms, but that this will have relatively small impact on the distribution of reef corals and coral reefs, perhaps affecting their minimum depths of occurrence. © 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd.","Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,ozone depletion;corals;ultraviolet (UV) radiation;UVB,,

Diversity (H') increases because of an increase in evenness following destruction or removal of the species that was monopolizing the space. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis as presented by Connell focuses on changes in number of species, but should be expanded to include diversity (H') and evenness. It should also be modified to incorporate changes in living cover and the time elapsed since disturbances of varying intensities. This hypothesis predicts that when cover is high, diversity will be low. However, research on coral reefs does not consistently demonstrate an inverse correlation of coral diversity and coral cover. An increase in cover and decrease in diversity with depth would also be expected because deeper reef zones generally experience less disturbance. However, higher diversity (both H' and species richness) is often associated with deeper zones. The effects of hurricanes on coral reefs will depend on the temporal and spatial scales under consideration, the life history characteristics and morphology of the dominant species, the depth of the reef zone, the ecological history of the site, and the influence of any additional natural or human stresses.","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Cyclonic Storms,,

Here, we first projected future MHW intensities for tropical regions under three future greenhouse gas emissions scenario (representative concentration pathways, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the near-term (2021-2040), mid-century (2041-2060) and late-century (2081-2100). We then combined these MHW intensity projections with a global data set of 1,788 experiments to assess coral attribute performance and survival under the three emissions scenarios for the near-term, mid-century and late-century in the presence and absence of OA. Although warming and OA had predominately additive impacts on the coral responses, the contribution of OA in affecting most coral attributes was minor relative to the dominant role of intensifying MHWs. However, the addition of OA led to greater decreases in photosynthesis and survival under intermediate and unrestricted emissions scenario for the mid- and late-century than if intensifying MHWs were considered as the only driver. These results show that role of OA in modulating coral responses to intensifying MHWs depended on the focal coral attribute and extremity of the scenario examined. Specifically, intensifying MHWs and OA will cause increasing instances of coral bleaching and substantial declines in coral productivity, calcification and survival within the next two decades under the low and intermediate emissions scenario. These projections suggest that corals must rapidly adapt or acclimatize to projected ocean conditions to persist, which is far more likely under a low emissions scenario and with increasing efforts to manage reefs to enhance resilience.","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,check full text",,climate change;coral bleaching;endosymbiosis;ocean warming;greenhouse gas emissions scenario;Military Personnel,,

There is now a race to develop a diverse set of solutions to save coral reefs. In this perspective, a case is made for understanding the cell biology of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis to help inform development of solutions for saving reefs. Laboratory model systems for the study of coral symbiosis, including the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida, are featured as valuable tools in the fight to save corals. The roles of host innate immunity and inter-partner nutrient dynamics in the onset, ongoing maintenance, and dysregulation of symbiosis are reviewed and discussed. Key innate immune genes and pathways, such as glycan-lectin interactions, the sphingosine rheostat, and the cytokine transforming growth factor beta are shown to modulate a host immune response in the symbiotic state. An upset in the homeostatic inorganic nutrient balance during heat stress and high exogenous nutrient availability is credited with driving the partnership toward dysregulation and coral bleaching. Specific examples are given where knowledge of the cell biology of symbiosis is informing the development of solutions, including studies showing clear limitations in the value of partner switching and acclimatization protocols. Finally, emphasis is placed on rapid advancement of knowledge to try to meet the urgent need for solutions. This includes real-time open communication with colleagues on successes and failures, sharing of resources and information, and working together in the spirit of a collective mission to save coral reefs.","Backup Publisher: Soc Integrat \& Comparat Biol Place: JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC Type: Article; Proceedings Paper | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,,,

Only 37 of the 141 global ecoregions that contain coral reefs were studied. All studies were restricted to shallow waters (0.5-27 m depth) and reported negative responses of corals to human disturbance. Our results reinforce the notion that corals are sensitive to anthropogenic changes. They reveal the scarcity of information on coral responses to pollution, tourism, overfishing and acidification, particularly in mesophotic ecosystems ({\textgreater} 30 m depth) and in ecoregions outside the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean.

This can have profound consequences for ecosystem services upon which human welfare depends. Understanding of this behavior is in many aspects still in its infancy. Resilience has been argued to provide insurance against unforeseen ecosystem responses in the face of environmental change, and has become a prime goal for the management of coral reefs. However, diverse definitions of resilience can be found in the literature, making its meaning ambiguous. Several studies have used the term as a theoretical framework and concern regarding its practical applicability has been raised. Consequently, operationalizing theory to make resilience observable is an important task, particularly for policy makers and managers dealing with pressing environmental problems. Ultimately this requires some type of empirical assessments, something that has proven difficult due to the multidimensional nature of the concept. Biodiversity, spatial heterogeneity, and connectivity have been proposed as cornerstones of resilience as they may provide insurance against ecological uncertainty. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the divergent uses of the concept and to propose empirical indicators of the cornerstones of coral reef resilience. These indicators include functional group approaches, the ratios of “good” and “bad” colonizers of space, measurements of spatial heterogeneity, and estimates of potential space availability against grazing capacity. The essence of these operational indicators of resilience is to use them as predictive tools to recognize vulnerability before disturbance occurs that may lead to abrupt phase shifts. Moving toward operationalizing resilience theory is imperative to the successful management of coral reefs in an increasingly disturbed and human-dominated environment.","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Resilience;Diversity;Management;Coral reefs;Functional groups;Phase shifts,,

We also summarize what is known regarding the role of coral microbiota in the health and disease of coral. We conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether the presence of unique taxa correlates with the state of coral health (i.e. healthy, diseased or bleached), as well as whether coral reef habitats harbor clusters of distinct taxa. We find that healthy and bleached corals harbor similar dominant taxa, although bleached corals had higher proportions of Vibrio and Acidobacteria. Diseased corals generally had more Rhodobacter, Clostridia, and Cyanobacteria sequences, and fewer Oceanospirillum sequences. We caution, however, that while 16S rRNA is useful for microbial species identification, it is a poor predictor of habitat or lifestyle, and care should be taken in interpretation of 16S rRNA surveys to identify potential pathogens amongst complex coral-microbial assemblages. Finally, we highlight evidence that coral-bacterial assemblages could be sensitive to the effects of climatic change.

However, evidence has been largely circumstantial, and much uncertainty remains. Here, I review the latest information on both the predicted effects of climate change in coastal marine ecosystems and current research on coral-pathogen dynamics in relation to climate variables. The published evidence supports the hypothesis that coral infectious diseases are emerging and demonstrates that coral disease research has been exponentially expanding over the last few decades. Current research suggests that environmental factors, such as ocean warming, altered rainfall, increased storm frequency, sea level rise, altered circulation, and ocean acidification may play a role in coral disease. These climate variables likely alter coral epidemiology through effects on pathogen growth rates, transmission, virulence, and susceptibility. Despite recent advances, discovering the causes of coral disease emergence at large spatial and temporal scales has been hindered by several factors including (1) the inability to rely on Koch's postulates for diseases with multifactorial etiologies, (2) the paucity of long-term, coordinated, coral disease data, and (3) the difficulty in detecting correlations in inherently non-linear, dynamic disease systems. In a rapidly changing global environment, the consequences of increasing coral disease may be severe, leading to elevated extinction risk and loss of critical reef habitat.

To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60\% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m(2).

Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59\% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70\%.

These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up projects, and to retain public trust in restoration as a tool for resilience based management.

The physiological characteristics associated with a particular lineage or species of Symbiodinium can determine a host's susceptibility to harmful bleaching. Therefore, the threat posed by global climate change on a host may be reduced if it can switch or shuffle its dominant algal symbiont type. An important prerequisite to this potential to switch or shuffle is the ability to host multiple alternative dominant symbiont genotypes. To examine the distribution of this trait, we review reports of mixed Symbiodinium infections in corals and nonscleractinian hosts from a phylogenetic perspective. Hosts showing evidence of mixed infection are broadly distributed across the most deeply divergent host lineages, including foraminifera, mollusks, sponges, and cnidarians. The occurrence of mixed infections is also broadly distributed across most clades of scleractinian corals. Individual colonies of certain well-studied cosmopolitan coral genera, such as Acropora, Montastraea, and Pocillopora, yield many reports of mixed infection, while other genera, such as Porites, do not. We further discuss mixed Symbiodinium infections in the context of evolutionary ecology theory. Selection pressures that affect the prevalence of mixed infection may be exerted by variation in host environment, host ontogeny, symbiont transmission strategy, host regulation of symbiont populations, availability of free-living symbiont lineages, competition between symbiont lineages, and niche partitioning of the internal host environment.","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted,check full text",,coral;symbiosis;dinoflagellate;ecology;Symbiodinium;mutualism;mixed infection;shuffling;switching,,

A multipartite microbial consortium dominated by Cyanobacteria, but also including sulfur-cycling bacteria, other bacterial groups and members of the Archaea and Eukarya, forms a sulfide-rich anaerobic mat that migrates across the surface of coral colonies, killing the underlying tissues. The polymicrobial nature of the disease challenges classic aetiological approaches to unravelling disease causation. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on the range of pathogens forming the microbial consortium with recent studies on the transmission, biogeochemistry and environmental drivers of BBD to develop a conceptual model of BBD pathogenesis. The model illustrates how the development of BBD virulence factors is linked to a cascade of microbial community shifts and associated functional roles that progressively develop the microbial consortium from comparatively benign cyanobacterial patches to virulent BBD lesions.

Although less expensive than digital imagery, exclusive use of these traditional tools may not be practical for monitoring large or remote coral reef ecosystems accurately. Researchers are attempting to develop an adequate coral reef mapping system based on digital remote sensing, but are impeded by issues such as effects of the intervening Mater column and spectral distinction of bottom types. The two variables discussed, which will contribute to our understanding of the global role of coral reefs, are: I) remote sensing of submerged coral reefs in general; and 2) remote sensing of coral bleaching in particular. A summary of radiative transfer theory is presented and case studies of attempts at mapping remotely the geographic extent and health of submerged ecosystems as well as a discussion of the remote estimation of water depth and quality. Problems in the translation and delivery of information to the end user are presented, and possible solutions suggested.","Place: 338 EUSTON ROAD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 3BH Publisher: ARNOLD, HODDER HEADLINE PLC Type: Review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,remote sensing;radiative transfer;coral health;coral reef ecosystem management,,

Climate change is exacerbating local impacts, causing unprecedented declines in coral reef habitats and bringing negative socioeconomic consequences to Pacific communities who depend heavily on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions will drive future climate change, which will accelerate coral reef degradation. Traditional systems of resource governance in Pacific island nations provide a foundation to address local pressures and build reef resilience to climate change. Management and adaptation options should build on the regional diversity of governance systems and traditional knowledge to support community-based initiatives and cross-sectoral cooperation to address local pressures and minimize climate change impacts. Such an inclusive approach will offer enhanced opportunities to develop and implement transformative adaptation solutions, particularly in remote and regional areas where centralized management does not extend.","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Patrice""=>""Included"", ""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Climate change;Pollution;Adaptation;Coral reefs;Fishing;Local impacts,,

H. and Medina, Monica",,English,,,"This review explores how microbial symbioses may have influenced and continue to influence the evolution of reef-building corals (Cnidaria; Scleractinia). The coral holobiont comprises a diverse microbiome including dinoflagellate algae (Dinophyceae; Symbiodiniaceae), bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, but here we focus on the Symbiodiniaceae as knowledge of the impact of other microbial symbionts on coral evolution is scant. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has extended the coral's metabolic capacity through metabolic handoffs and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and has contributed to the ecological success of these iconic organisms. It necessitated the prior existence or the evolution of a series of adaptations of the host to attract and select the right symbionts, to provide them with a suitable environment and to remove disfunctional symbionts. Signatures of microbial symbiosis in the coral genome include HGT from Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria, gene family expansions, and a broad repertoire of oxidative stress response and innate immunity genes. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has permitted corals to occupy oligotrophic waters as the algae provide most corals with the majority of their nutrition. However, the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis is sensitive to climate warming, which disrupts this intimate relationship, causing coral bleaching, mortality and a worldwide decline of coral reefs.

For nearly a century, researchers have delved into understanding the coral-algal mutualism from multiple levels of resolution and perspectives, and the questions and scope have evolved with each iteration of new techniques. Advances in genetic technologies not only aided in distinguishing between the multitude of Symbiodiniaceae but also illuminated the existence and diversity of other organisms constituting the coral microbiome. The coral therefore is a meta-organism, often referred to as the coral holobiont. In this review, we address the importance of including a holistic perspective to understanding the coral holobiont. We also discuss the ramifications of how different genotypic combinations of the coral consortium affect the holobiont entity. We highlight the paucity of data on most of the coral microbiome. Using Symbiodiniaceae data, we present evidence that the holobiont properties are not necessarily the sum of its parts. We then discuss the consequences of the holobiont attributes to the fitness of the holobiont and the myriad of organisms that contribute to it. Considering the complexity of host-symbiont genotypic combinations will aid in our understanding of coral resilience, robustness, acclimation, and/or adaptation in the face of environmental change and increasing perturbations.","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,symbiosis;Symbiodiniaceae;microbiome;holobiont;mutualism;coral reefs,,

Here, we describe the recent shift from costly and complex engineering solutions to recover degraded reef structure to more economical and efficient ecological approaches that focus on recovering the living components of reef communities. We review the adoption and expansion of the coral gardening framework in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic where practitioners now grow and outplant 10,000's of corals onto degraded reefs each year. We detail the steps for establishing a gardening program as well as long-term goals and direct and indirect benefits of this approach in our region. With a strong scientific basis, coral gardening activities now contribute significantly to reef and species recovery, provide important scientific, education, and outreach opportunities, and offer alternate livelihoods to local stakeholders. While challenges still remain, the transition from engineering to ecological solutions for reef degradation has opened the field of coral reef restoration to a wider audience poised to contribute to reef conservation and recovery in regions where coral losses and recruitment bottlenecks hinder natural recovery.","Place: 341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND Publisher: PEERJ INC Type: Article | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Samantha""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: extracted",,Coral reef restoration;Acropora;Florida;Caribbean;Ecological services;Coral gardening;Coral nurseries;Coral propagation;Threatened corals;Western Atlantic;Caribbean Region,,
